<p>Thanks to artificial intelligence, WordPress AI website builders are making it easier than ever to build professional-looking sites in less time. </p>
<p>Of all the tools we’ve tried, SeedProd has been our go-to choice. We’ve used it to create attractive and high-converting landing pages for our partner brands.</p>
<p>That being said, not everyone has the same needs or preferences as ours. With so many different AI website builders for WordPress, you may be wondering which one is best for you.</p>
<p>Because of that, we decided to put the most popular AI website builders to the test.</p>
<p>We’ve tested both free and premium options so you can find the perfect AI-powered solution for your WordPress website, regardless of your budget or experience level. This article will look at the pros and cons of each tool, breaking down its features, ease of use, and overall value.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How We Hand-Picked and Tested WordPress AI Site Builders</h4>
<p>For this review, we installed and tested each AI-powered WordPress plugin and theme on our own sites. We went through the entire process of setting up themes and building pages, just as you would when creating your own website.</p>
<p>Additionally, we use some of these tools, like SeedProd, in our daily operations. Meanwhile, when it comes to Bluehost AI Site Creator, Divi AI, and Elementor AI, we’ve extensively tested these for tutorials on WPBeginner because lots of our readers ask about them.</p>
<p>During our testing, we paid close attention to several key factors:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Website setup: </strong>We considered how easy it is to get started with each tool. For instance, some AI site builders ask more questions during setup, while others allow for more customization later on. </li>
<li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> We evaluated how user-friendly each tool is, especially for beginners. In addition to intuitive AI-powered features, we also looked for things like drag-and-drop editors, template libraries, and built-in design elements.</li>
<li><strong>AI capabilities:</strong> We tested the quality and speed of AI-generated designs, content, and images. We also looked for less common AI functionality like <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-automatically-translate-wordpress-easy-method/" title="How to Automatically Translate WordPress (Easy Method)">automatic translation</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Customization options:</strong> We looked at how much control users have over AI-generated elements. For example, some site builders have more advanced image generators that let you easily tweak your prompts to get improved versions. Meanwhile, others allow you to pick color schemes or fonts before generating a site or web page.</li>
<li><strong>User reviews</strong>: We thoroughly tested every AI website builder on this list, but we know that there are infinite possibilities when it comes to web design. So, we consulted many customer reviews to get more insight.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing:</strong> We considered the value for money, including free plans and trials.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.seedprod.com/wordpress-ai-theme-builder/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="SeedProd WordPress AI Theme Builder">SeedProd</a> is the overall best AI website builder for WordPress, and we’ve used it a lot across our different brands. For example, at OptinMonster, a landing page made with SeedProd boosted conversions by a whopping 340%.</p>
<p>We’ve also covered the page builder plugin much more extensively in our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/solutions/seedprod/" title="SeedProd">SeedProd review</a>.</p>
<p>SeedProd’s AI website builder is really cool. You just describe what business the website is for, wait up to a minute, and it creates a whole website or landing page for you. This makes it simple to build a professional website, even if you’re not a web design expert.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Entering a prompt in SeedProd's AI theme builder" class="wp-image-314565 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-lawn-wranglers-min.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-lawn-wranglers-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-lawn-wranglers-min-300x171.png 300w" decoding="async" height="388" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='388'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20388'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Entering a prompt in SeedProd's AI theme builder" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Entering a prompt in SeedProd's AI theme builder" class="wp-image-314565" decoding="async" height="388" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-lawn-wranglers-min.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-lawn-wranglers-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-lawn-wranglers-min-300x171.png 300w" title="Entering a prompt in SeedProd's AI theme builder" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>One downside of SeedProd’s AI website builder is that you need to export the AI-generated design and import it yourself to your own website using the SeedProd plugin. It’s not a deal-breaker, but you’ll find that some plugins on the list don’t require this, so it can feel like an extra step.</p>
<p>But SeedProd does more than just build websites. It also has AI tools for writing content and improving images. The AI can change your text to make it simpler, longer, shorter, or sound different. It can even translate your content into more than 50 languages.</p>
<p>The AI can edit images, create new versions, and improve their appearance to fit your website perfectly.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Options to edit an AI image with SeedProd" class="wp-image-285888 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-variations-min.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-variations-min.jpg 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-variations-min-300x171.jpg 300w" decoding="async" height="388" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='388'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20388'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Options to edit an AI image with SeedProd" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Options to edit an AI image with SeedProd" class="wp-image-285888" decoding="async" height="388" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-variations-min.jpg" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-variations-min.jpg 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-variations-min-300x171.jpg 300w" title="Options to edit an AI image with SeedProd" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p><strong>Pros of SeedProd:</strong></p>
<p>SeedProd is the fastest AI website builder we’ve tried. While it says it can take around 60 seconds to create one website or landing page, it usually takes us about 10 to 40 seconds maximum.</p>
<p>What’s more, it makes great designs even with little input from you. The tool doesn’t ask a lot of questions before generating your website, but the quality of the site itself is still really good.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Example of an AI-generated theme made with SeedProd" class="wp-image-299805 perfmatters-lazy" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-ai-example.gif" decoding="async" height="329" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='329'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20329'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Example of an AI-generated theme made with SeedProd" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Example of an AI-generated theme made with SeedProd" class="wp-image-299805" decoding="async" height="329" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-ai-example.gif" title="Example of an AI-generated theme made with SeedProd" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>Once SeedProd’s AI builder generates the initial website design, you can also easily move things around on your page with its drag-and-drop tool.</p>
<p>Plus, it has lots of built-in features like <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-rotating-testimonials-in-wordpress/" title="How to Add Rotating Testimonials in WordPress">rotating testimonials</a>, countdown clocks, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-show-a-number-count-animation-in-wordpress/" title="How to Show a Number Count Animation in WordPress">animated number counters</a>, and progress bars. These help make your website more engaging, without installing extra WordPress plugins.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons we keep recommending SeedProd is that it’s so easy to use and figure out, even without a tutorial. Often, you need pointers from the plugin developer on how to use the tool, but SeedProd’s dashboard and editor are pretty clear, making it easy to get started on your own.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="The SeedProd interface" class="wp-image-302017 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/seedprod-interface-min.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/seedprod-interface-min.jpg 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/seedprod-interface-min-300x169.jpg 300w" decoding="async" height="382" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='382'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20382'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="The SeedProd interface" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="The SeedProd interface" class="wp-image-302017" decoding="async" height="382" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/seedprod-interface-min.jpg" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/seedprod-interface-min.jpg 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/seedprod-interface-min-300x169.jpg 300w" title="The SeedProd interface" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>And, if you’re not a fan of AI-generated design, then you don’t have to worry. SeedProd also has over <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-seedprod-site-kits-and-templates/" title="Best SeedProd Site Kits and Templates (Expert Pick)">350 landing page templates and theme kits</a> for various industry categories, so you can get started on your project right away.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of SeedProd:</strong></p>
<p>As we pointed out earlier, the AI website builder isn’t part of the main plugin. You have to make your design with AI, and then move it to your own site, which takes an extra step.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Exporting a SeedProd theme file" class="wp-image-304058 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-import-min.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-import-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-import-min-300x156.png 300w" decoding="async" height="354" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='354'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20354'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Exporting a SeedProd theme file" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Exporting a SeedProd theme file" class="wp-image-304058" decoding="async" height="354" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-import-min.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-import-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/seedprod-import-min-300x156.png 300w" title="Exporting a SeedProd theme file" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>That said, SeedProd’s intuitive export/import tools make this process very straightforward.</p>
<p><strong>Why we chose SeedProd: </strong>We picked SeedProd as the best AI WordPress website builder because it’s super fast and easy to use, with lots of design features.</p>
<p>Whether you’re new to making websites or you’ve been doing it for years, SeedProd has everything you need to make a great website quickly and easily.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>You can get the free version of the SeedProd plugin, but it doesn’t have AI features. Paid plans cost from $39.50 to $239.60 per year. All paid plans give you dozens of templates, unlimited pages, and professional blocks to add to your design.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bluehost Homepage">Bluehost AI Site Creator</a> combines hosting and AI website building into one seamless package. We’re impressed by how it simplifies the process of <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/start-a-wordpress-blog/" title="How to Start a WordPress Blog (Beginner’s Guide)">creating a WordPress blog</a> or site, especially for beginners who might find the traditional setup overwhelming.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Bluehost, we’ve talked about the hosting company before in our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/hosting/bluehost/" title="Bluehost">Bluehost review</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: When you sign up for a WordPress hosting plan with Bluehost, the software is automatically installed for you. During the onboarding process, you can choose to use the AI Site Creator.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Using the Bluehost AI Site Creator" class="wp-image-299815 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bluehost-ai-site-creator-min.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bluehost-ai-site-creator-min.jpg 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bluehost-ai-site-creator-min-300x163.jpg 300w" decoding="async" height="369" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='369'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20369'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Using the Bluehost AI Site Creator" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Using the Bluehost AI Site Creator" class="wp-image-299815" decoding="async" height="369" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bluehost-ai-site-creator-min.jpg" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bluehost-ai-site-creator-min.jpg 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bluehost-ai-site-creator-min-300x163.jpg 300w" title="Using the Bluehost AI Site Creator" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>Then, you simply enter a prompt and upload a logo (optional), and the AI generates three design options for you. At this point, you can <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-choose-a-perfect-color-scheme-for-your-wordpress-site/" title="How to Choose a Perfect Color Scheme for Your WordPress Site">customize the color scheme</a> if you want, and then Bluehost installs your chosen AI-generated theme for you.</p>
<p>One drawback is that this is only available with Bluehost and not with other hosting providers. This means you’ll need to consider whether Bluehost’s hosting services meet your needs before deciding to use their AI website builder.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Bluehost AI Site Creator:</strong></p>
<p>The speed of the AI Site Creator is impressive. In our tests, it took about a minute to generate three distinct designs. This quick turnaround allows you to get your site up and running in no time.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Choosing a theme generated by Bluehost AI Site Creator" class="wp-image-299811 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bluehost-ai-site-generated-designs-min.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bluehost-ai-site-generated-designs-min.jpg 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bluehost-ai-site-generated-designs-min-300x150.jpg 300w" decoding="async" height="342" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='342'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20342'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Choosing a theme generated by Bluehost AI Site Creator" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Choosing a theme generated by Bluehost AI Site Creator" class="wp-image-299811" decoding="async" height="342" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bluehost-ai-site-generated-designs-min.jpg" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bluehost-ai-site-generated-designs-min.jpg 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bluehost-ai-site-generated-designs-min-300x150.jpg 300w" title="Choosing a theme generated by Bluehost AI Site Creator" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>One of the biggest advantages is that it works with the built-in <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-edit-a-wordpress-website-ultimate-guide/" title="How to Edit a WordPress Website (Ultimate Guide)">WordPress block editor</a>. This means you can customize your website without needing an extra plugin.</p>
<p>The AI Site Creator also works with WonderBlocks, which adds more blocks and patterns to your design toolkit. What we found useful is that WonderBlocks creates patterns that already match your web design, so you only need to make minimal tweaks.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Bluehost's WonderBlocks feature" class="wp-image-304887 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bluehost-wonderblocks-min.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bluehost-wonderblocks-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bluehost-wonderblocks-min-300x125.png 300w" decoding="async" height="284" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='284'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20284'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Bluehost's WonderBlocks feature" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Bluehost's WonderBlocks feature" class="wp-image-304887" decoding="async" height="284" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bluehost-wonderblocks-min.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bluehost-wonderblocks-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bluehost-wonderblocks-min-300x125.png 300w" title="Bluehost's WonderBlocks feature" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>For its price, Bluehost AI Site Creator offers great value. You don’t need to make separate purchases for <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/" title="How to Choose the Best WordPress Hosting (Compared)">WordPress hosting</a> and a site builder, and the prices start as low as $1.99 per month.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of Bluehost AI Site Creator:</strong></p>
<p>We did notice that sometimes, the AI chose stock photos or design elements that did not match our prompt description. However, this isn’t a major issue as these elements can be easily changed to better suit your preferences.</p>
<p>Also, while WonderBlocks adds a good range of blocks and patterns, we found that it’s not as extensive or advanced as a dedicated page builder like SeedProd.</p>
<p><strong>Why we chose Bluehost AI Site Creator:</strong> We selected Bluehost AI Site Creator as the best hosting and site builder bundle because it offers an all-in-one solution at an affordable price point.</p>
<p>It’s particularly well-suited for beginners or those who want to quickly launch a professional-looking website without dealing with separate hosting and design tools. </p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Plans start from $1.99 to $9.99 per month. All plans include AI Site Creation tools, support for multiple websites, a free <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-register-a-domain-name-simple-tip-to-get-it-for-free/" title="How to Register a Domain Name (and get it for FREE)">domain name</a> for the first year, and free professional email.</p>

<p>Based on our testing, we found <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/elegant-themes-divi-ai/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elegant Themes Divi AI">Divi AI</a> to be perfect for those who want powerful AI-driven image and content creation tools built into a flexible WordPress theme. It’s great for designers who want to speed up their work and make their websites look better.</p>
<p>After buying a plan and activating your license, you can create a custom theme with the Divi <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-wordpress-theme-builders/" title="Best WordPress Theme Builders (Compared)">theme builder</a> and then use AI to generate images and text. While we initially found the tool a bit challenging to navigate, we were able to figure it out eventually.</p>
<p>You can also make a new page and use the Divi AI page builder. You’ll simply enter a prompt like with other AI builders, but Divi AI lets you customize more. For example, you can pick your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-customize-colors-on-your-wordpress-website/" title="How to Customize Colors on Your WordPress Website">favorite colors</a> and fonts before you start designing, giving you more control over how your site looks.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Divi AI:</strong></p>
<p>Divi AI lets you set your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-add-custom-fonts-in-wordpress/" title="How to Add Custom Fonts in WordPress">preferred fonts</a> and colors before the AI starts designing. This means the AI-generated designs can match your brand from the start. Although this may seem minor, this feature helped save us some time during the design adjustment stage.</p>
<p>The AI quick actions feature is also really useful for improving your content. You can use it to make your text better, rewrite it, make it easier to understand, translate it, or change how it sounds.</p>
<p>Divi AI offers a wide range of AI image enhancement features. You can upscale images, selectively enhance specific parts, add or modify elements, and more. This level of image editing is particularly useful for creating unique, high-quality visuals for your site.</p>
<p>We were also impressed with Divi AI’s realistic images of people. It even got pretty close to creating normal-looking hands, which is often hard for AI image creators.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Divi AI's image generator" class="wp-image-304885 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/divi-ai-min.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/divi-ai-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/divi-ai-min-300x180.png 300w" decoding="async" height="409" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='409'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20409'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Divi AI's image generator" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Divi AI's image generator" class="wp-image-304885" decoding="async" height="409" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/divi-ai-min.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/divi-ai-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/divi-ai-min-300x180.png 300w" title="Divi AI's image generator" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>(Though if you look very closely, you can see some of the fingers are a bit unusual.)</p>
<p>The ‘Generate Automatically’ feature is another standout for us. It saves time and makes sure your pictures match your content. For instance, if your website is about a bakery, Divi AI will automatically create relevant images displaying things like fresh bread or a cozy baker’s kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of Divi AI:</strong></p>
<p>The AI page builder can be confusing at first. We didn’t realize right away that we had to create a new page using the block editor before we could use the AI features. This might be frustrating for some users.</p>
<p>Overall, Divi AI’s interface isn’t as easy to use as some other options on our list, especially for beginners. The theme builder is powerful, but it takes time to learn how to use it fully.</p>
<p><strong>Why we chose Divi AI: </strong>We picked Divi AI as the best for AI image and content creation because it had the best tools for improving both pictures and text. It can automatically create images that fit your content, has advanced image editing features, and powerful tools to improve your writing.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>New users can get Divi AI for $227 per year. If you already use Divi, you can add AI features for $16.08 more per month. There’s no limit on how much you can use the AI features, which is great.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/zipwp/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="ZipWP">ZipWP</a> is created by Brainstorm Force, the team behind the popular <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/astra-theme-pricing-page/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Astra Theme Pricing Page">Astra theme</a>. This free AI website builder is an excellent choice for those who want to try out AI-powered website creation without spending money upfront.</p>
<p>When we first signed up for a plan, ZipWP provided a helpful video walkthrough to get us started. You then answer questions about the kind of website you’re making and enter a detailed prompt.</p>
<p>But, like SeedProd, you need to export and import the design into your own WordPress site to be able to use it.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="ZipWP's customization features" class="wp-image-304883 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zipwp-customize-min.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zipwp-customize-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zipwp-customize-min-300x130.png 300w" decoding="async" height="295" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='295'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20295'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="ZipWP's customization features" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="ZipWP's customization features" class="wp-image-304883" decoding="async" height="295" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zipwp-customize-min.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zipwp-customize-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/zipwp-customize-min-300x130.png 300w" title="ZipWP's customization features" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p><strong>Pros of ZipWP:</strong></p>
<p>One of the things we like about ZipWP is it allows you to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-upload-large-images-in-wordpress/" title="How to Upload Large Images in WordPress">upload your own images</a> before the website is generated. This means you can ensure your brand’s visuals are incorporated from the start, giving you more control over the final look of your site.</p>
<p>In our tests, we found that ZipWP can create 50 or more website generations. This gives you plenty of options to choose from, increasing the likelihood of finding a design that matches your vision.</p>
<p>You can select specific features to add to your website, such as a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-practices-of-contact-form-page-designs-in-wordpress/" title="Best Practices for Contact Form Page Design (With Examples)">contact form</a>, donation form, or eCommerce functionality. This customization helps tailor the site to your specific needs.</p>
<p>The Spectra website builder, which comes with ZipWP, works with the WordPress block editor. This way, you can edit your content and design in the same place, making the customization process more streamlined.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of ZipWP:</strong></p>
<p>For free plan users, some template options are locked behind a premium paywall. If there’s a specific feature you want, you might have to pay extra to access it.</p>
<p>If you already have existing hosting, you’ll need to export and import the design to your host. This adds an extra step to the setup process, which might be inconvenient for some users.</p>
<p><strong>Why we chose ZipWP:</strong> We selected ZipWP as the best free AI website builder because it offers a robust set of features even in its free plan. The ability to create multiple website generations and add specific features makes it stand out among free options.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> ZipWP offers a free plan that allows for 2 AI site generations and 1000 AI credits. For one-time use, you can pay $79 for 5 AI site generations, 10,000 AI credits, and access to premium designs.</p>
<p>Yearly subscriptions range from $199 to $399 per year, offering up to 10 AI site generations per day, 100,000 AI credits, and team collaboration features.</p>

While it isn’t a full AI site builder that creates a website from scratch, it comes with a bunch of AI tools to help you design different parts of your site.</p>
<p>Our general opinion of Elementor is that it’s like Photoshop for websites. It might take some time to master, but once you do, you can create a pretty powerful site. You can learn more about the page builder in our full <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/solutions/elementor/" title="Elementor">Elementor review</a> and our comparison piece about <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/opinion/elementor-vs-divi-vs-seedprod/" title="Elementor vs Divi vs SeedProd (Compared) – Which is the Best?">Elementor vs. Divi vs. SeedProd</a>.</p>
<p>It offers content generation, image creation, image enhancement, layout or container generation (both from prompts and automatically based on your site’s look), and even CSS code generation.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Elementor AI:</strong></p>
<p>The layout generator is really smart. It can create layouts based on what the rest of your site looks like, which helps give you ideas for new sections. You can also use prompts to guide the layout generator if you have something specific in mind.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Elementor's AI container generator" class="wp-image-302111 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/elementor-ai-container-min.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/elementor-ai-container-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/elementor-ai-container-min-300x158.png 300w" decoding="async" height="358" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='358'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20358'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Elementor's AI container generator" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Elementor's AI container generator" class="wp-image-302111" decoding="async" height="358" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/elementor-ai-container-min.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/elementor-ai-container-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/elementor-ai-container-min-300x158.png 300w" title="Elementor's AI container generator" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>Elementor AI’s content generator is quite impressive. At the beginning, you can tell it what kind of site you’re creating, and it will keep this in mind every time you generate content. This means you’re more likely to get relevant content that fits your site’s purpose.</p>
<p>The image enhancement settings are a standout feature. Not only can you generate new images, but you can also improve existing ones, which is great for fine-tuning your site’s visuals.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of Elementor AI:</strong></p>
<p>In one of our tests, we found that the AI image generator struggled with creating realistic human hands, which is a common challenge for AI image creators. </p>
<p>The CSS code generator also took a few tries to produce the right code. It might require some patience and tweaking to get exactly what you want.</p>
<p>Generally, Elementor’s design interface may feel overwhelming for complete beginners because of the sheer number of settings and options available.</p>
<p><strong>Why we chose Elementor AI:</strong> The smart layout generator, context-aware content creation, and image enhancement tools make Elementor pretty powerful. While the learning curve is slightly steeper, Elementor AI offers unmatched customization for those willing to invest the time to master it.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>Elementor AI is available to all Elementor users. You just need an Elementor account and the latest version of the Elementor plugin. Free plan users can start with a free trial of the AI features.</p>
<p>For Elementor Pro, prices start from $59 per year and go up to $399 per year. All plans include Elementor AI, theme builder, dynamic content features, and some access to pro widgets (depending on the plan).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/10web-homepage/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="10web Homepage">10Web</a> offers an all-in-one solution that combines an AI website builder with WordPress hosting by Google Cloud. It’s perfect for users who want a hassle-free experience from website creation to ongoing management.</p>
<p>With 10Web, you create a website using a prompt on their platform. Then, you can purchase a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/managed-wordpress-hosting/" title="When Do You Really Need Managed WordPress Hosting? Best Managed WordPress Hosting Compared">managed WordPress hosting plan</a> to edit and manage your site further.</p>
<p>10Web provides a dedicated dashboard that displays all your AI-generated sites, allowing you to log in to each WordPress admin directly from the 10Web dashboard.</p>
<p>But, like Bluehost, you can only use 10Web’s builder if you purchase its hosting plan.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of 10Web:</strong></p>
<p>When testing, one standout feature we noticed about 10Web was that it doesn’t just create a design. It also shows you the planned structure of your website, which you can edit. This gives you more control over your site’s setup from the start, ensuring it meets your specific needs.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Viewing the AI-generated site structure made by 10Web" class="wp-image-304882 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/10web-structure-min.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/10web-structure-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/10web-structure-min-300x169.png 300w" decoding="async" height="382" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='382'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20382'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Viewing the AI-generated site structure made by 10Web" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Viewing the AI-generated site structure made by 10Web" class="wp-image-304882" decoding="async" height="382" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/10web-structure-min.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/10web-structure-min.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/10web-structure-min-300x169.png 300w" title="Viewing the AI-generated site structure made by 10Web" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>10Web also offers a unique feature that lets you convert an existing site into WordPress using AI. This is incredibly useful if you’re looking to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-wordpress-migration-services/" title="Best WordPress Migration Services (Compared)">migrate your site to WordPress</a> or want to give your current site an AI-powered makeover.</p>
<p>The platform uses a white-labeled version of Elementor, which includes its AI content and image-generation tools.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of 10Web:</strong></p>
<p>The main drawback is that you’re locked into 10Web’s managed hosting. While their hosting is robust, this lack of flexibility might be a concern if you prefer to choose a different or more affordable hosting provider.</p>
<p><strong>Why we chose 10Web:</strong> Its ability to show and allow edits to the website structure during generation, coupled with the option to convert existing sites to WordPress using AI, sets 10Web apart. Just keep in mind that you’ll need to use their hosting to use the website builder.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Plans start from $10 per month and go up to $60 per month. Higher-tier plans allow for more websites and provide more storage space. All plans include unlimited AI-generated pages, Google Cloud hosting, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-get-a-free-ssl-certificate-for-your-wordpress-website/" title="How to Get a Free SSL Certificate for Your WordPress Website (Beginner’s Guide)">free SSL</a>, and a speed booster.</p>

<p><a href="https://kubiobuilder.com/ai/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kubio AI">Kubio AI</a> has a similar interface to the default WordPress block editor. This is great for users who are used to using Gutenberg or the full-site editor but want some AI capabilities to build their site.</p>
<p>After installing the plugin on your site, you can use the Kubio editor to generate an entire page based on your prompt. You can then easily adjust the hero image and color scheme if needed. </p>
<p>Kubio AI also offers AI content and image generators for more specific customizations.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that our experience with Kubio wasn’t smooth from start to finish. We had to repeat some prompts to make the tool work, but this may not be the case for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Kubio AI:</strong></p>
<p>Kubio AI offers three flexible options to generate a section: ‘surprise’ mode for a completely new design without a prompt, choosing a design and letting Kubio generate the content, or regenerating content and images while keeping the same design.</p>
<p>This versatility allows you to fine-tune your pages exactly how you want them.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-use-ai-to-generate-images-in-wordpress/" title="How to Use AI to Generate Images in WordPress">AI image generation</a> feature includes a mode to change the image style, such as photographic or other styles. This gives you more control over the visual feel of your site.</p>
<p>The content generator is quite powerful, allowing you to make text shorter or longer, fix spelling, change the tone, or completely regenerate the content. This helps you quickly refine your site’s messaging.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of Kubio AI:</strong></p>
<p>In our tests, we found that Kubio AI could be slow at times. Occasionally, the AI generator didn’t even work, requiring us to repeat the process. This might be frustrating if you’re working on a tight schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Why we chose Kubio AI: </strong>The tool’s three-option approach to generating sections gives users a high degree of control over their design process. Plus, the familiar interface, combined with powerful AI content and image generation tools, makes it accessible to WordPress users of all levels.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>Kubio AI offers a free plan that allows you to create a homepage with AI and regenerate page sections. Full features are available in paid plans starting from $8.25 per month and up to $31.58 per month. All paid plans include thousands of AI credits and priority support.</p>

<p>If you want to use a website builder other than WordPress, then <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hostinger-website-builder/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hostinger AI Website Builder">Hostinger Website Builder</a> can be a great alternative. It offers a simpler approach to website creation.</p>
<p>With Hostinger AI Website Builder, you pick a hosting plan, enter a prompt and type of website, choose a color palette (optional), and then have the tool generate a website for you.</p>
<p>It’s a much simpler option than WordPress because the content management system is not as advanced. That being said, beginners can get started on their website much more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Hostinger AI Website Builder:</strong></p>
<p>Hostinger offers one of the most flexible drag-and-drop editors we’ve tried. You can literally move elements anywhere on the page, while the grid system helps keep things proportional. This gives you great design freedom while maintaining a professional look.</p>
<p>Unlike other hosted website builders like <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/wix/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Wix">Wix</a>, where you often need to upgrade to a higher plan with redundant features to get more server resources, here you can just upgrade the hosting if needed. This flexibility can save you money as your site grows.</p>
<p>Hostinger also provides tons of templates for different industry categories, giving you a wide range of starting points for your website design.</p>
<p>The AI heatmap tool is a standout feature. It helps you understand how visitors interact with your site, allowing you to optimize your layout for better engagement and conversions.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Hostinger Website Builder's AI heatmap" class="wp-image-303415 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hwb-ai-heatmap-min.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hwb-ai-heatmap-min.jpg 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hwb-ai-heatmap-min-300x169.jpg 300w" decoding="async" height="382" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='382'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20382'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Hostinger Website Builder's AI heatmap" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Hostinger Website Builder's AI heatmap" class="wp-image-303415" decoding="async" height="382" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hwb-ai-heatmap-min.jpg" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hwb-ai-heatmap-min.jpg 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hwb-ai-heatmap-min-300x169.jpg 300w" title="Hostinger Website Builder's AI heatmap" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p><strong>Cons of Hostinger AI Website Builder:</strong></p>
<p>It’s not the best platform for blogging due to its very simple content management tools. That’s why Hostinger AI Website Builder is better suited for business sites without a blog section.</p>
<p>While the platform technically allows switching to WordPress, you cannot export website styles and layouts, online stores, integrations, forms, collected submissions, or SEO settings.</p>
<p>You can only export regular pages, texts, images, and other files. This limits your ability to migrate your site if you decide to switch platforms later.</p>
<p><strong>Why we chose Hostinger AI Website Builder:</strong> We included Hostinger AI Website Builder as a WordPress alternative because it offers a simpler, more straightforward approach to website creation.</p>
<p>Its AI-powered features and drag-and-drop editor make it an excellent choice for small businesses or individuals who want to create a professional-looking website quickly without the complexity of WordPress.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Plans start from $2.99 to $3.99 per month. All plans include 100 sites, a free domain, mobile editing, and free professional email.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">WordPress AI Website Builders: Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<p>Here are some common questions we’ve received about AI website builders for WordPress:</p>
<p><strong>How does an AI website builder work behind the scenes?</strong></p>
<p>AI website builders use machine learning algorithms to analyze your descriptions and generate website designs based on that information. They’re trained on vast datasets of existing websites, design principles, and user preferences.</p>
<p>When you provide a prompt, the AI interprets it, selects appropriate layouts and elements, and then assembles them into a cohesive website design.</p>
<p><strong>Is there an AI website builder for WordPress?</strong></p>
