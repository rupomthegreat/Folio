<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What Is Podcast Hosting?</h4>
<p>Podcast hosting is a specialized service that offers to store and deliver media files associated with a podcast.</p>
<p>Just like you need a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/" title="How to Choose the Best WordPress Hosting (Compared)">website hosting service</a> to store all your website files, podcast hosting offers the same service but for your podcast’s media files.</p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering whether you could just use your website hosting to store your podcast files as well.</p>
<p>You can do that, but that wouldn’t be good for your website or your listeners.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why Do You Need Podcast Hosting?</h4>
<p>You see, podcast episodes are large files. Delivering them from the same server as your website will take a lot of server resources. This will make your website slower, and it could even crash during high load.</p>
<p>If several users start downloading at the same time, then most <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/the-truth-about-shared-wordpress-web-hosting/" title="The Truth About Best Shared WordPress Web Hosting">shared hosting</a> services will simply block the processes that are taking up server resources. This means users will not be able to download your podcast.</p>
<p>And that’s precisely why you need a podcast hosting service.</p>
<p>These companies specialize in storing and delivering large media files. They are made specifically for podcasters and have specialized tools to handle this use case. </p>
<p>You also get support from folks who are specialists in the industry. This makes a huge difference in the long run.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How We Test and Review Podcasting Hosting</h4>
<p>To ensure we provide our readers with the most accurate and helpful information, we use a strict testing and review process for all the podcast hosting platforms featured on our site. Our tests are based on a comprehensive set of criteria that directly address the needs and expectations of podcasters:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> We assess how easy the platform is for both new and experienced podcasters. This includes the onboarding process, interface design, and overall user experience. </li>
<li><strong>Audio Quality:</strong> We evaluate the quality of the audio produced by the platform, considering factors like bitrate, compression, and overall clarity. As a podcaster, it is important that the platform provides exceptional audio quality.</li>
<li><strong>Features:</strong> We assess the range of features offered, including episode scheduling, analytics, monetization options, and integrations with other tools and plugins. Plus, we also looked at distribution options so you can easily publish your podcast on multiple platforms. </li>
<li><strong>Reliability:</strong> We test the platform’s uptime and reliability, ensuring that podcasts are consistently available to listeners. </li>
<li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> We evaluate the quality and responsiveness of the platform’s customer support, checking how well they address user inquiries and resolve issues. </li>
<li><strong>Pricing:</strong> We compare pricing plans and value offerings to determine which platforms offer the best value for the money.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/podbean/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Podbean">PodBean</a> is the overall best podcast hosting service provider on the market.

<p>Aside from that, we also liked that they have podcast promotion tools that automatically submit your episodes to all top podcast directories, like Spotify and Apple Podcasts. This allows your audience to use their preferred tools to listen to and download podcasts.</p>
<p>PodBean offers an advertising marketplace that provides opportunities for podcasters to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/make-money-online/" title="Proven Ways to Make Money Online Blogging with WordPress">monetize their content</a>. They also have a huge community of podcasters already using PodBean as their podcasting platform.</p>

We really liked that they offer an easy-to-use platform that puts your brand at the center and helps you promote your podcast across different platforms, apps, and devices.</p>
<p>Libsyn started in 2004, which makes it one of the very first podcast hosting service providers. The platform was created by podcasters for other podcasters and has a large community of users, including some of the most influential creators.</p>
<p>They offer three podcast hosting plans with different monthly storage limits but with unlimited bandwidth.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Easy-to-use podcast hosting platform</li>
<li>Publish your podcast to popular platforms</li>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="SoundCloud">7. SoundCloud</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="SoundCloud">SoundCloud</a> is a popular music and podcast hosting platform. The best feature we found while testing was that you can embed any podcast episode from the platform by simply placing the URL anywhere in your WordPress posts and pages.</p>
<p>SoundCloud is free for up to 3 hours of uploads. Their free plan is a good starting point for beginners who want to test the waters first.</p>
<p>Their paid plans come with more storage, bandwidth, advanced statistics, monetization, and distribution options. SoundCloud is easy to use, but it is not the most flexible or customizable podcast hosting plan.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Free plan offers up to 3 hours of uploads</li>
<li>Easily embed SoundCloud podcast to WordPress</li>
<li>Share private tracks with collaborators</li>
<li>Supports popular distribution platforms in the pro version</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Pro version can be expensive for new podcasters</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why We Recommend SoundCloud:</strong> We recommend SoundCloud to users who want to embed episodes into their WordPress pages and posts. </p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free plan with 3 hours of uploads per month. Paid plans start from $99 per year.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Which Is the Best Podcast Hosting Service?</h4>
<p>As you can see, many podcast hosting services offer similar plans with all the essential features. However, some put limits on storage space, and some limit downloads.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, we recommend <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/podbean/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Podbean">PodBean</a> as the overall best podcast hosting service. Their plans come with unlimited storage and bandwidth with an incredibly easy-to-use platform. They also allow you to easily promote your podcast across different services.</p>
<p>Our second recommendation is <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/buzzsprout/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="BuzzSprout">Buzzsprout</a>. It is one of the easiest podcast hosting solutions, perfect for beginners to get started.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to Start a Podcast</h4>
<p>Apart from a podcast hosting service, you will also need a website. This will be your podcast’s home on the internet, where you will promote it and help users discover more content.</p>
<p>To make a website, you will need a domain name and a website hosting account.</p>
<p>The domain name will typically cost you $14.99 per year, and website hosting plans start from $7.99 per month, usually paid annually.</p>
<p>Since you are just starting out, you will want to save money whenever you can.</p>
<p>Luckily, our friends at <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> are offering WPBeginner users a free domain and a generous discount on hosting.</p>

<p>Next, you will need to set up your podcast. We have created a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/step-by-step-guide-how-to-start-a-podcast-with-wordpress/" title="How to Start Your Own Podcast (Step by Step)">step-by-step guide to starting a podcast</a> for beginners, it will walk you through the complete setup, including how to record your podcasts.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What Equipment Do You Need for Podcasting?</h4>
<p>Many professional podcasters use a variety of equipment to record podcasts. This includes microphones, an audio interface, a mixer, a windscreen, shock mounts, and more.</p>
<p>All of this equipment costs a lot of money.</p>
<p>However, you don’t need all of them just to record a Podcast. The only equipment we recommend buying from the start is a good microphone.</p>
<p>We recommend using <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/rode-podcaster/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Rode Podcaster">Rode Podcaster</a>, which you can plug into your computer using a USB port.</p>
<p>If you can spare a little more money, then you can purchase the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/rode-podcaster-kit/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Rode Podcaster Kit">Rode Podcaster Kit</a>, which comes with a boom arm and a shock mount.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative:</strong> <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/samson-mic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Samson Mic">Samson C01UCW</a> is a good entry-level microphone to record podcasts.</p>
<p>Once your podcast grows and you are making money from it, then you can invest in improving your setup. But remember, you can’t improve something if you don’t start it, so just start!</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to Promote Your Podcast</h4>
<p>Many of the podcast hosting services mentioned above allow you to automatically submit your podcast to different podcast directories and search engines.</p>
<p>You can also manually submit your podcast. Once approved, your podcast and all its episodes will become discoverable on these platforms.</p>
<p>Your podcast is published as an RSS feed. You will need to copy the podcast feed URL provided by your podcast hosting service.</p>
<p><strong>How to Submit Your Podcast to iTunes or Apple Podcasts</strong></p>
<p>iTunes is the world’s largest podcast directory, allowing users to subscribe to podcasts using their iPhones, Apple computers, iPods, and other Apple devices.</p>
<p>First, you will need to sign in to the <a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/login" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="iTunes Connnect">iTunes Connect</a> website using your Apple ID. If you don’t have one, then you sign up to create one for free.</p>
