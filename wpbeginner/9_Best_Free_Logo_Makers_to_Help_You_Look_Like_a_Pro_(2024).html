<p>A logo is one of the most important parts of your brand. It helps your business look professional and sets you apart from the competition.</p>
<p>At WPBeginner, we use a few design tools, including Adobe Illustrator, which is excellent for logo making. That said, we understand that it may not be the best fit if you’re looking for free and beginner-friendly solutions.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are easy-to-use, free logo makers that can make the process highly straightforward. You don’t need to hire a designer or spend a lot of money to have a polished, professional-looking logo.</p>
<p>So, we downloaded and tested popular free logo makers for this roundup. After researching and testing, we’ve created a list of the best, based on their strengths for different purposes.</p>
<p>In this article, let’s look at the 9 best free logo makers to help you design like a pro.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why Do You Need a Great Logo?</h4>
<p>You need a great logo to create and establish a brand identity for your business, blog, or <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-build-your-personal-brand-using-wordpress/" title="How to Build Your Personal Brand Using WordPress">personal brand</a>.</p>
<p>Think of a logo as your business’s profile picture. You’ll use it on your website, online store, social media accounts, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-create-an-email-newsletter/" title="How to Create an Email Newsletter the RIGHT WAY (Step by Step)">email newsletter</a>, and business cards.</p>
<p>It helps your customers identify and associate your business with a visual identity.</p>
<p>Your logo reflects your brand’s values. A great logo should match the colors and style of your brand’s visual identity, creating consistency across all marketing materials and a cohesive and unified brand image.</p>
<p>Over time, your logo will begin to stick into your audience’s minds, which helps reinforce brand recognition.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, you’d pay a professional designer to create a logo for you. But when you’re facing the other <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-wordpress-website/" title="How Much Does It Really Cost to Build a WordPress Website?">costs of building a website</a>, you might need a cheaper or even free logo option.</p>
<p>Using a logo maker is a great alternative to hiring a design company to produce <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-places-to-get-a-custom-logo-for-your-wordpress-website/" title="Best Places to Get a Custom Logo for Your WordPress Website">a custom logo for your website</a>.</p>
<p>Each of the logo makers below is free to use. Note that with some, you’ll need to pay to download and keep the logo you come up with.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How We Test and Review Logo Makers</h4>
<p>When creating our list of the best logo makers, we considered the following criteria:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong>: In our opinion, a great logo maker should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing you to create your logo without unnecessary frustration. We looked for easy editing tools so you don’t have to waste your time and creativity.</li>
<li><strong>Customization Options:</strong> How much control do you have over your design? We checked for tools that let you tweak <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-web-safe-fonts/" title="What Is a Web Safe Font + 19 Best Web Safe Fonts (Beginner’s Guide)">fonts</a>, colors, and symbols to fit your vision.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of Logos:</strong> We evaluated whether the logo looked professional and polished. We also checked for high-resolution logos, which are essential for both web and print use.</li>
<li><strong>File Types and Usability:</strong> We assessed the file formats available for your logo, such as <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/webp-vs-png-vs-jpeg/" title="WebP vs. PNG vs. JPEG: The Best Image Format for WordPress">WebP, PNG, and JPEG</a>, to ensure they meet your specific needs.</li>
<li><strong>Extra Features:</strong> We looked for additional tools that can enhance your business or online presence. We took note of things like <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/social-media-cheat-sheet-for-wordpress/" title="The Complete Social Media Cheat Sheet for WordPress (Updated)">social media</a> kits, branding guidelines, and animations.</li>
<li><strong>Price and Value:</strong> We also considered whether you get good features for the cost. Some tools are free, while others charge for premium options.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/tailor-brands-logo-maker/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Tailor Brands' logo maker">Tailor Brands</a> is perfect for those who want a quick and easy solution.</p>
<p>Of all the tools we tested, it offers one of the most incredibly user-friendly processes. You can simply type in your brand name and optional tagline and select a few design preferences. Then, it will generate a professional logo in seconds.</p>
<p>Here’s a logo we created for an imaginary company, Monster Movies. The logo maker generated this for us after we picked the options we wanted:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Example logo for Monster Movies created by Tailor Brands logo maker" class="wp-image-307315 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tailor-brands-logo-portfolio.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tailor-brands-logo-portfolio.png 548w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tailor-brands-logo-portfolio-300x142.png 300w" decoding="async" height="260" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='548'%20height='260'%20viewBox='0%200%20548%20260'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Example logo for Monster Movies created by Tailor Brands logo maker" width="548"/><noscript><img alt="Example logo for Monster Movies created by Tailor Brands logo maker" class="wp-image-307315" decoding="async" height="260" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tailor-brands-logo-portfolio.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tailor-brands-logo-portfolio.png 548w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tailor-brands-logo-portfolio-300x142.png 300w" title="Example logo for Monster Movies created by Tailor Brands logo maker" width="548"/></noscript></figure>
<p>Do note that you must sign up to view the generated logo.</p>
<p>After signing up, you’ll be shown alternative logos to choose from in addition to your main logo. If you don’t like any of them, you can click to keep creating more, which we think is very generous of the tool.</p>
<p>We also like that Tailor Brands lets users customize the generated logo by changing the style, fonts, text spacing, color, and more.</p>
<p>Once you’re done, you can download the logo with a single payment.</p>
<p>In addition, you might see monthly pricing.</p>
<p>However, we found you don’t need the subscription unless you’re using Tailor Brands’ other services, such as its social media management tools, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-choose-the-best-website-builder/" title="Best Website Builders Compared &amp; Tested">website builder</a>, and more. The best value way to get all the features is to pay $12.99/month upfront for a year.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Total beginners, particularly those who want to use Tailor Brands’ other tools, too.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/looka/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Looka's logo maker">2. Looka’s Logo Maker</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/looka/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Looka's logo maker">Looka</a> is best for users who need high-resolution logos for print or professional use.</p>
<p>To create your logo, you type in your company name, select the industry you are in, and then tell Looka what styles you like. Based on our experience, these handy steps ensure that users get a polished logo suitable for various applications.</p>
<p>With Looka, you get to choose up to 3 colors and symbols that you think would suit your brand. If you’re stuck or open to all possibilities, though, you can skip this step.</p>
<p>Like with Tailor Brands’ logo creator, we found that users need to log in or create an account to view their logos. Upon signing in, you can scroll through lots of options and pick up the one that you’d like to customize. Here are some of the options it generated for us:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Several logo options created by Looka's logo maker for Monster Movies" class="wp-image-307317 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/looka-template-logos.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/looka-template-logos.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/looka-template-logos-300x250.png 300w" decoding="async" height="459" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='550'%20height='459'%20viewBox='0%200%20550%20459'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Several logo options created by Looka's logo maker for Monster Movies" width="550"/><noscript><img alt="Several logo options created by Looka's logo maker for Monster Movies" class="wp-image-307317" decoding="async" height="459" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/looka-template-logos.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/looka-template-logos.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/looka-template-logos-300x250.png 300w" title="Several logo options created by Looka's logo maker for Monster Movies" width="550"/></noscript></figure>
<p>When customizing a logo, we appreciate how easy it is to preview different fonts, colors, and style combinations. We can then pick any option we want and make changes to our design.</p>
<p>Once everything is done, you’ll need to buy your finished logo to use it.</p>
<p>We found that the cheapest option here is $20. But you can also pay up to $65 if you want additional files, such as resized logo versions for social media profiles. And based on our findings, these are one-off costs, not recurring payments.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/smashinglogo/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Smashing Logo">Smashing Logo</a> is perfect for those seeking highly customizable logos and complete branding kits.</p>
<p>One thing that stood out to us is that it lets you start quickly by selecting keywords and attributes for your brand. This is in addition to choosing fonts and colors to create a design that truly represents your vision.</p>
<p>After trying it out ourselves, the logo maker shows us a unique design based on our preferences. We can then customize it as much as we want.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Smashing Logo Maker example" class="wp-image-307318 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/smashing-logo.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/smashing-logo.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/smashing-logo-300x166.png 300w" decoding="async" height="305" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='550'%20height='305'%20viewBox='0%200%20550%20305'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Smashing Logo Maker example" width="550"/><noscript><img alt="Smashing Logo Maker example" class="wp-image-307318" decoding="async" height="305" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/smashing-logo.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/smashing-logo.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/smashing-logo-300x166.png 300w" title="Smashing Logo Maker example" width="550"/></noscript></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/shopify-hatchful/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Hatchful logo maker">Hatchful</a>, developed by Shopify, is great for anyone looking to quickly create multiple logo versions.</p>
<p>We tested it out and had a fun and intuitive logo-creating process, as it allowed us to generate various logo options with just a few clicks. We believe that this will definitely cater to users who want choices without the hassle.</p>
<p>Plus, you can keep generating more options until you get something that you like.</p>
<p>Here’s what we got for Monster Movies:</p>

<p>While we found the customization a bit limited, it’s very easy to do. You can simply click on a logo to edit the font, colors, and icon if your chosen logo has one.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we love the fact that it’s free to download our chosen logo.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/canva-logo-maker/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Canva Pro Logo Maker">Canva Pro</a> is designed for website owners who need to create various graphics beyond just logos.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional logo makers, Canva Pro has a comprehensive graphic design tool that enables you to create anything from logos to social media posts. In our honest opinion, this makes Canva Pro a versatile choice for broader design needs.</p>
<p>One interesting thing we found during our research was that Canva’s product is very similar to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/adobe-photoshop/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Adobe Photoshop">Adobe Photoshop</a>, except that it’s much easier to use. With Canva, you have a bunch of searchable logo templates that you can then modify as much as you want.</p>
<p>Here’s one we created for Monster Movies:</p>

<p>To download your logo, you’ll need to sign up for a free Canva account.</p>
<p>However, we think the free plan is a bit limited. If you need access to the full range of tools, then you’ll need to upgrade to Canva Pro, which costs $119.99 per year for a single user.</p>
<p>Upgrading to Canva Pro allows you to upload your own fonts. It also unlocks the brand kits feature, allowing you to create and store all your branding elements, including logos.</p>
<p>You can also consider subscribing to Canva Pro for $12.95 per month or trying it free for 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Website owners who want to create other graphics beyond just logos. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ucraft.com/free-logo-maker" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Ucraft logo maker">Ucraft</a> is best for those who prefer quick, icon-based logos with a cartoonish style.</p>
<p>Like Hatchful, Ucraft is a completely free logo creator that allows users to design simple, fun logos without any cost. We found this particularly attractive, especially for budget-conscious creators.</p>
<p>Using Upcraft takes a different approach from most of the logo makers we’ve looked at so far, though. It doesn’t generate a logo for you or offer templates. Instead, it gives you a blank canvas to design your unique logo.</p>
<p>Among the number of icons to choose from, we thankfully found dozens of monster-related ones. These icons come from <a href="https://thenounproject.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Noun Project">The Noun Project</a>, and they’re the same as the ones used by <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/squarespace/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Noun Project">Squarespace</a>‘s logo creator.</p>
<p>We’re a big fan of Upcraft’s easy and intuitive logo-making process. With a drag-and-drop interface, you can easily add icons, text, and basic shapes.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Monster Movies logo created with Ucraft logo maker" class="wp-image-307320 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/creating-ucraft-logo.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/creating-ucraft-logo.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/creating-ucraft-logo-300x118.png 300w" decoding="async" height="217" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='550'%20height='217'%20viewBox='0%200%20550%20217'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Monster Movies logo created with Ucraft logo maker" width="550"/><noscript><img alt="Monster Movies logo created with Ucraft logo maker" class="wp-image-307320" decoding="async" height="217" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/creating-ucraft-logo.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/creating-ucraft-logo.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/creating-ucraft-logo-300x118.png 300w" title="Monster Movies logo created with Ucraft logo maker" width="550"/></noscript></figure>
<p>One downside is that Upcraft has a very limited selection of fonts unless you upload additional ones. Also, you don’t have the fine-tuned controls that some other logo makers provide, like the option to adjust the letter spacing. </p>
<p>On the other hand, you don’t need to pay anything to download your logo.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Quick icon-based logos, particularly if you want a slightly cartoonish style.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/designhill/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Designhill logo maker">Designhill</a> logo maker is ideal for generating numerous logo options based on chosen symbols.</p>
<p>When reviewing this tool, we found that it functions similarly to Looka – allowing you to select your favorite brands and 3 colors to make sure you get a variety of designs that align with your preferences.</p>
<p>When selecting options in the generator, you’ll have an image search feature to find and choose potential symbols for your logo. As with Ucraft’s icons, these are supplied by The Noun Project.</p>
<p>The logo generator will then generate a set of different designs. To view them, you’ll need to enter your name and email address. Here’s what we got for our Monster Movies brand:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Logos created with Designhill for Monster Movies" class="wp-image-72680 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/designhill-created-logo.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/designhill-created-logo.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/designhill-created-logo-300x188.png 300w" decoding="async" height="344" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='550'%20height='344'%20viewBox='0%200%20550%20344'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Logos created with Designhill for Monster Movies" width="550"/><noscript><img alt="Logos created with Designhill for Monster Movies" class="wp-image-72680" decoding="async" height="344" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/designhill-created-logo.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/designhill-created-logo.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/designhill-created-logo-300x188.png 300w" title="Logos created with Designhill for Monster Movies" width="550"/></noscript></figure>
<p>If you don’t like any of the logos created for you, that’s totally okay, as Designhill lets you generate more.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found a logo you like, you can click on it to edit it. The editor will then prompt you to sign up for an account.</p>
<p>After signing up, you’ll be redirected to the content editor. Here, you’ll have control over changing the font size and spacing, which is great. We also liked that it offers you a wide range of different fonts to choose from.</p>
<p>When you want to use the logo, you’ll need to click on the ‘Buy’ button at the top right corner of the editor. Designhill will then price the logo based on the logo you picked and the design elements you used.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Generating lots of logo options that use symbols you’ve picked.</p>

<p>We particularly appreciate that many of the images available are a lot more colorful and detailed than the icons that some other logo generators provide. There are also some good options for simpler graphics if that suits your brand better.</p>

<p>One critique we have for GraphicSprings is that there’s no easy way to search the images. You have to scroll through them to find one that you like.</p>
<p>Once you’ve designed a logo you’re happy with, you can download your logo files for a one-off fee of $19.99.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Creating a detailed, potentially colorful logo.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.logogenie.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Logogenie">Logogenie</a> is perfect for those who want detailed logo editing, particularly in text customization and element layering.</p>
<p>When it comes to logo generation, Logogenie works similarly to other tools we have on this list: it gathers essential information from you and generates a range of logos</p>
<p>Here’s what they came up with for us:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Logos created in Logogenie for Monster Movies" class="wp-image-307324 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/creating-logogenie-logos.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/creating-logogenie-logos.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/creating-logogenie-logos-300x173.png 300w" decoding="async" height="317" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='550'%20height='317'%20viewBox='0%200%20550%20317'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Logos created in Logogenie for Monster Movies" width="550"/><noscript><img alt="Logos created in Logogenie for Monster Movies" class="wp-image-307324" decoding="async" height="317" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/creating-logogenie-logos.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/creating-logogenie-logos.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/creating-logogenie-logos-300x173.png 300w" title="Logos created in Logogenie for Monster Movies" width="550"/></noscript></figure>
<p>Once you’ve chosen a logo, you can modify it by changing the colors, fonts, and more. There’s a reasonable range of fonts and a good number of icons to choose from.</p>
<p>That said, our overall impression is that this logo creator is a little more advanced than some other options, which can feel overwhelming for beginners. For example, it lets you tweak the letter spacing of your fonts and move elements in front of or behind others.</p>
<p>Plus, Logogenie isn’t the cheapest logo generator. Your logo will cost $24.90, and you might want to pay for additional options such as vector and social network formats. Then, you’ll need to pay more if you want extra options, like social network formats.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Detailed logo editing, particularly of the text on your logo.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What Is the Best Logo Maker?</h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bonus: How to Add a Verified Logo to Your Business Email</h4>
<p>Email is super important for any business, especially if you’re running one through a WordPress site. You want your emails to reach your customers and actually get read.</p>
<p>The problem is that people get tons of emails every day, many from spammers and scammers. This makes them question whether your emails are safe, so they might avoid clicking on them.</p>
<p>You need a way to reassure your readers and customers. A verified logo can help with that!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Emails with verified logos" class="wp-image-307927 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/emails-with-verified-logo-examples.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/emails-with-verified-logo-examples.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/emails-with-verified-logo-examples-300x68.png 300w" decoding="async" height="124" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='550'%20height='124'%20viewBox='0%200%20550%20124'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Emails with verified logos" width="550"/><noscript><img alt="Emails with verified logos" class="wp-image-307927" decoding="async" height="124" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/emails-with-verified-logo-examples.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/emails-with-verified-logo-examples.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/emails-with-verified-logo-examples-300x68.png 300w" title="Emails with verified logos" width="550"/></noscript></figure>
