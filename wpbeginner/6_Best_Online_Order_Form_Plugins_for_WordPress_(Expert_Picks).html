<p>Creating an efficient online ordering system is important for every eCommerce store. It helps streamline the purchasing process and boost the customer experience. </p>
<p>However, WordPress doesn’t offer order form features by default. You’ll need an eCommerce plugin to get them.</p>
<p>At WPBeginner, we were already using WPForms for our contact forms and realized that it could also be used to create online order forms. So, we further investigated our favorite form builder alongside other popular order form tools to share a list of the best options with you.</p>
<p>Each plugin has unique features that cater to different types of businesses. Whether you’re selling products, services, or digital downloads, there’s a solution for you. </p>
<p>Now, let’s go over some of the best order form plugins for WordPress!</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How We Test and Review Online Order Form Plugins</strong></h4>
<p>When we looked at online order form plugins, we considered several important factors to ensure we were able to recommend the best options. Here’s how we tested and reviewed these plugins:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> We paid attention to how user-friendly the form builder interface is. A good plugin should be easy to navigate so even non-techy users can <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-create-a-contact-form-in-wordpress/" title="How to Create a Contact Form in WordPress (Step by Step)">create forms</a> without hassle.</li>
<li><strong>Online Order Form Templates:</strong> We checked if the plugin offers specific templates designed for online orders. These templates save time and help users get started quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Payment Features:</strong> We looked at the available <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-create-wordpress-forms-with-a-payment-option/" title="How to Create a WordPress Form with Payment Options (Easy Way)">payment options</a>. Can the plugin handle one-time payments? What about recurring payments? These features are crucial for businesses that sell products or services regularly.</li>
<li><strong>eCommerce Platform and Payment Integrations:</strong> We evaluated how well the plugin integrates with popular <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-free-ecommerce-platforms/" title="Best Free eCommerce Platforms (Compared)">eCommerce platforms</a> and multiple payment options. Smooth integration means less hassle for users when setting up their stores.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Experience:</strong> Even before testing them specifically for this tutorial, we already had lots of real-world experience with some of the order form tools on this list. We know a lot about <a href="https://wpforms.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="WPForms - Drag &amp; Drop WordPress Form Builder">WPForms</a>, in particular, since we use it on our site. However, we have also tried some of the other tools previously while experimenting with testing sites. </li>
<li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Finally, we considered the cost. We checked if the pricing is reasonable for the features offered and if there are any free options available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering all these factors, we aim to provide honest and helpful reviews that will help you choose the best order form plugin for WordPress.</p>

<p>If you want to <strong>sell just one product</strong> on your site, then you don’t need a full-fledged online store or a fancy shopping cart. Instead, you can create a simple order form for customers to fill out. <a href="https://wpsimplepay.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="WP Simple Pay - WordPress Payments Plugin">WP Simple Pay</a>, a top Stripe plugin for WordPress, lets you set all this up.</p>
<p>Feel free to get more information about the platform in our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/solutions/wp-simple-pay/" title="WP Simple Pay Review">complete WP Simple Pay review</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike many Stripe plugins, WP Simple Pay <strong>doesn’t charge an extra 3% fee</strong> on transactions, which we think is a huge plus! Also, while it has a strong reputation for its integration with Stripe, it also supports more than 10 <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-woocommerce-payment-gateways-wordpress/" title="Best WooCommerce Payment Gateways for WordPress">payment gateways</a>.</p>
<p>After installing, you’ll follow a simple setup wizard to connect your Stripe account. You’ll then easily find a template to fit your needs. This lets you create a form that matches your business without starting from scratch.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="WP Simple Pay form templates" class="wp-image-226336 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WP-Simple-Pay-form-templates-1-1.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WP-Simple-Pay-form-templates-1-1.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WP-Simple-Pay-form-templates-1-1-300x138.png 300w" decoding="async" height="312" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='312'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20312'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="WP Simple Pay form templates" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="WP Simple Pay form templates" class="wp-image-226336" decoding="async" height="312" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WP-Simple-Pay-form-templates-1-1.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WP-Simple-Pay-form-templates-1-1.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WP-Simple-Pay-form-templates-1-1-300x138.png 300w" title="WP Simple Pay form templates" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>Then, we found WP Simple Pay’s Stripe<strong> automatic tax calculation</strong> to be very handy. It’s based on where your customers are, which helps you save time and stay compliant so you can focus more on your business.</p>
<p>When it comes to inventory management, this plugin also makes it easy. During our research, we discovered that WP Simple Pay <strong>automatically shows or hides forms based on stock levels</strong>, which helps you maintain customer trust by preventing sales of out-of-stock items.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Easy to create an order form without needing a full online store</li>
<li>Doesn’t charge an additional 3% transaction fee</li>
<li>Offers templates that suit your business needs</li>
<li>Automatically calculates taxes based on customer location</li>
<li>Automatically shows or hides forms based on stock levels</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Best suited for selling a single product only</li>
<li>The free 3% transaction fee is for the pro version only</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why we chose the WP Simple Pay plugin:</strong> Based on our findings, WP Simple Pay’s user-friendly templates, automatic features, and easy integration with Stripe make it a great choice for anyone looking to sell products online. That said, it can also be a streamlined option if you only want to sell a single product.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Stripe Payment Forms by WP Simple Pay offers <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/stripe" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="WP Simple Pay - Free Stripe Plugin for WordPress">a free option</a>, but it charges a 3% transaction fee. To remove this fee and unlock more features, you can upgrade to a premium plan starting at $49.50 per year for the Personal plan.</p>

<p>Like Formidable Forms, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/gravityforms/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gravity Forms">Gravity Forms</a> is a popular choice for building complex WordPress order forms. However, the main difference is that Gravity Forms has a much higher number of CRM integrations for managing customer data. </p>
<p>Although we don’t use it on our website, we downloaded and thoroughly tested Gravity Forms to check if it deserves the hype. Here’s our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/solutions/gravity-forms/" title="Gravity Forms Review">full Gravity Forms review</a> if you want to learn more about this plugin.</p>
<p>During setup, we found <strong>3 pre-made templates</strong> you can use to create an online order form. They are ‘Ecommerce PayPal Form Template,’ ‘Ecommerce Stripe Form Template,’ and ‘Ecommerce Form Template.’</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Gravity Forms' order form templates" class="wp-image-303749 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gravityforms-orderforms.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gravityforms-orderforms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gravityforms-orderforms-300x143.png 300w" decoding="async" height="324" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='324'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20324'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Gravity Forms' order form templates" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Gravity Forms' order form templates" class="wp-image-303749" decoding="async" height="324" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gravityforms-orderforms.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gravityforms-orderforms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gravityforms-orderforms-300x143.png 300w" title="Gravity Forms' order form templates" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>Gravity Forms works with popular payment gateways like Stripe, PayPal, Authorize.net, and Mollie. With its <strong>Payment add-ons</strong>, you can sell digital downloads or physical products easily. We also discovered that you can handle one-time and <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-accept-recurring-payments-in-wordpress/" title="How to Accept Recurring Payments in WordPress">recurring payments</a>.</p>
<p>When testing Gravity Forms, one feature that stood out was its ‘Dynamic Population’ field.</p>
<p>This lets customers <strong>pre-fill fields</strong> like a phone number or email if they already have that info. It makes filling out forms easier and helps reduce the chances of people <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/ways-to-recover-woocommerce-abandoned-cart-sales/" title="Ways to Recover WooCommerce Abandoned Cart Sales">abandoning their orders</a>.</p>
<p>Now, do note that Gravity Forms’ Pro plan costs $159 a year, and it includes <strong>eCommerce add-ons</strong> you might need for all these to work. If you’re already using CRMs like Zoho or Capsule, this plan has just what you need to keep things running smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
