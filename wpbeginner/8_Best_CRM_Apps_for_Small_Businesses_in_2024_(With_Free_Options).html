<p>As business owners ourselves, we’re very familiar with CRM software and why it’s important for managing customer relationships, increasing sales, handling leads, and growing your business.</p>
<p>We’ve been long-time fans of HubSpot and FunnelKit, finding them incredibly helpful for customer relationships. But we also know that not every business has the same needs or resources. </p>
<p>That’s why we decided to put these tools to the test, along with several other popular options, to see if they truly are the best choices out there.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll share our findings to help you, our readers, make an informed decision. We’ll compare the top CRM software in terms of features, pricing, and usability, weighing the pros and cons of each.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How We Reviewed the Best CRM Software</h4>
<p>To help you find the best CRM software for your small business, we’ve carefully evaluated each option based on key factors that matter most to growing companies. Here’s what we considered in our review process:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong> – We put a strong emphasis on user-friendliness. After all, 67% of businesses say it’s the most important feature. If a CRM is hard to use, it won’t help your business grow and improve your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-customer-service-software/" title="Best Customer Service Software for Business (Compared)">customer service</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud and Mobile Capabilities</strong> – We favored cloud-based CRMs, which make up 87% of the market today. They’re more secure, faster, and play well with other apps. We also looked for mobile-friendly options, as 65% of companies using mobile CRMs exceed their sales targets.</li>
<li><strong>Essential Features</strong> – We created a checklist of must-have features for small businesses. While every company’s needs are unique, we focused on CRMs that go beyond being just a fancy address book. The best options integrate with your marketing, sales, and lead generation processes.</li>
<li><strong>Integration Options</strong> – We checked how well each CRM works with other tools you likely use, like your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/guides/" title="How to Make a WordPress Website - Easy Tutorial - Create Website">WordPress website</a>, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-email-marketing-services/" title="7 Best Email Marketing Services for Small Business">email marketing service</a>, and social media platforms. The more integrations available, the more versatile the CRM.</li>
<li><strong>Value for Money</strong> – While we didn’t solely focus on price, we considered the value each CRM offers. We looked at free plans, paid options, and what you get at different price points.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hubspot-crm/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="HubSpot CRM">HubSpot</a> is one of the best CRM software for small businesses we’ve tried, and it’s great for those looking for a cost-effective solution to get started. It offers free plans for its CRM, Marketing, Sales, and Service hubs.</p>
<p>The free HubSpot CRM comes with unlimited users and unlimited contacts. It is also free forever. If you want more information, we’ve covered the tool extensively in our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/solutions/hubspot/" title="HubSpot">HubSpot review</a>. </p>
<p>HubSpot is quite easy to use, and you can connect marketing, sales, and service hubs to your CRM software. This provides you with a wide range of tools to efficiently manage the customer journey.</p>
<p>With an easy user interface, you get a bird’s eye view of your entire sales pipeline on your dashboard. You can view detailed reports, all contact activities, sales activities, and user/team performance.</p>
<p>HubSpot offers a comprehensive set of features, including mobile apps for iPhone and Android, a contact manager, email templates, real-time notifications, phone calls, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-set-up-email-newsletter-tracking-in-google-analytics/" title="How to Set Up Email Newsletter Tracking in Google Analytics">email tracking</a>, scheduling, and more.</p>
<p>Integrations are crucial for CRM software. HubSpot integrates with more than 300 apps and services, including WordPress, top <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-email-marketing-services/" title="Best Email Marketing Services for Small Business">email marketing services</a>, lead generation software like <a href="https://www.optinmonster.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="OptinMonster">OptinMonster</a>, and many more.</p>
<p>One thing we don’t really like is many of the features are limited or unavailable in the free plan. To access the powerful features, you will need to upgrade to one of their paid plans under the Growth Suite.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> HubSpot offers the core CRM platform for free. For more features, you can upgrade to their paid plans for Marketing, Sales, and Service hubs, which start from $15 per month per user. </p>
