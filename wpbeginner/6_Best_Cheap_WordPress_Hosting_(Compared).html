<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why Choose Cheap WordPress Hosting?</h4>
<p>When you <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/guides/" title="How to Make a WordPress Website - Easy Tutorial - Create Website">create a WordPress website</a>, you will need to pay for two things: a web hosting plan and a domain name. Web hosting is where your website files and content are stored, and a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-register-a-domain-name-simple-tip-to-get-it-for-free/" title="How to Register a Domain Name (+ simple tip to get it for free)">domain name</a> is the address your users will use to visit your site.</p>
<p>Because all websites need these, WordPress hosting prices are very competitive and often cover the cost of your domain name for the first year.</p>
<p>If you are just starting out or have a tight budget, then you may be looking for the best cheap hosting you can find. Or you might prefer not to spend much on hosting if you are creating a test website or a site for students to practice on.</p>
<p>We recommend that you avoid <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-free-website-hosting-compared/" title="Best Free Website Hosting Compared">free website hosting</a>. These companies may try to save money by limiting your website traffic, and will often try to make money by displaying ads or upselling their other services, leading to a poor experience for you and your visitors. </p>
<p>You will have a better experience by choosing an inexpensive plan from one of the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/hosting/" title="Best Web Hosting Companies">best web hosting companies</a>.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to Get the Best Cheap WordPress Hosting</h4>
<p>Reputable web hosting companies usually offer multiple pricing options so that you can find something that fits your needs and budget. Here are a few ways you can save money.</p>
<p><strong>Save Money on Hosting by Choosing the Cheapest Plan</strong></p>
<p>If you are just starting out or have simple needs, then you can save money by choosing the cheapest plan the hosting company offers.</p>
<p>But be aware that you get what you pay for. A company’s cheapest hosting plan is designed to save beginners money and is cheap because it is limited.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Hosting Plan With Cheapest Price" class="wp-image-232197 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingcheapestplan.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingcheapestplan.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingcheapestplan-300x132.png 300w" decoding="async" height="299" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='299'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20299'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Hosting Plan With Cheapest Price" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Hosting Plan With Cheapest Price" class="wp-image-232197" decoding="async" height="299" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingcheapestplan.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingcheapestplan.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingcheapestplan-300x132.png 300w" title="Hosting Plan With Cheapest Price" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>For example, the cheapest plans can usually only host one website and offer less storage space than more expensive plans. They also may lack features offered by other plans.</p>
<p>So make sure that the cheapest plan meets your needs before you choose it.</p>
<p><strong>Save Money on Hosting Using an Introductory Offer or Coupon Code</strong></p>
<p>Most hosting companies offer heavy discounts to new customers. That means when you first sign up for hosting, you will be paying a fraction of what the hosting normally costs.</p>
<p>To save even more money, you can use one of our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/deals/#hosting-deals" title="WPBeginner Hosting Deals">coupon codes</a>. We have negotiated the best web hosting deals for WPBeginner readers, so make sure you don’t miss out.</p>
<p><strong>Save Money on Hosting by Paying in Advance</strong></p>
<p>To get the special initial price, most hosting companies will need you to pay at least a year in advance. That’s a good thing and will save you money because you will be charged the normal amount when it is time to renew your hosting.</p>
<p>You can save even more money by paying for multiple years in advance. Some hosting companies allow you to pay for 3-4 years upfront.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Pay in Advance to Save Money on Hosting" class="wp-image-232198 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingpayinadvance.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingpayinadvance.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingpayinadvance-300x88.png 300w" decoding="async" height="200" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='200'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Pay in Advance to Save Money on Hosting" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Pay in Advance to Save Money on Hosting" class="wp-image-232198" decoding="async" height="200" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingpayinadvance.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingpayinadvance.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingpayinadvance-300x88.png 300w" title="Pay in Advance to Save Money on Hosting" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p><strong>Save Money on Hosting by Considering the Renewal Price</strong></p>
<p>If you are looking to save money in the long term, then make sure you consider the renewal cost. The introductory discount lasts for just one payment, and the renewal price is what you will be paying for years to come.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Check Your Hosting Plan's Renewal Price" class="wp-image-232199 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingrenewalprice.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingrenewalprice.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingrenewalprice-300x128.png 300w" decoding="async" height="290" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='290'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20290'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Check Your Hosting Plan's Renewal Price" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Check Your Hosting Plan's Renewal Price" class="wp-image-232199" decoding="async" height="290" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingrenewalprice.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingrenewalprice.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingrenewalprice-300x128.png 300w" title="Check Your Hosting Plan's Renewal Price" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>By default, most web companies will automatically renew your hosting for the same period as when you first signed up. You can save money by renewing 12 months or more in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Individual Payments by Paying Month-to-Month</strong></p>
<p>To get the best deal on web hosting, you need to pay for a year or more in advance. While you will be saving money in the long term, your individual payments will cost more.</p>
<p>If you have limited money on hand, then you may prefer to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-monthly-web-hosting-plans/" title="Best Monthly Web Hosting Plans">pay for your web hosting month-to-month</a>. While you will end up paying more in the long term, your monthly payments will be more manageable.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Paying for Hosting Month-to-Month" class="wp-image-232200 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingmonthbymonth.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingmonthbymonth.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingmonthbymonth-300x87.png 300w" decoding="async" height="197" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='197'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20197'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Paying for Hosting Month-to-Month" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Paying for Hosting Month-to-Month" class="wp-image-232200" decoding="async" height="197" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingmonthbymonth.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingmonthbymonth.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cheaphostingmonthbymonth-300x87.png 300w" title="Paying for Hosting Month-to-Month" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>However, since the cheapest web hosting plans cost just over $30 for the first year, we recommend that you choose the month-to-month option only when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>All that being said, let’s take a look at the best cheap WordPress hosting companies. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th> </th><th>Cheapest Monthly</th><th>First Year</th><th>Annual Renewal</th><th>Month-to-Month</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Bluehost</a></td><td>$1.99</td><td>$23.88</td><td>$143.88</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hostgator/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="HostGator">HostGator</a></td><td>$2.52</td><td>$30.84</td><td>$143.88</td><td>$4.78</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/dreamhost/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">DreamHost</a></td><td>$2.59</td><td>$35.40</td><td>$83.88</td><td>$7.99</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hostinger/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Hostinger">Hostinger</a></td><td>$2.69</td><td>$34.45</td><td>$143.88</td><td>$10.79</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/greengeeks/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="GreenGeeks">GreenGeeks</a></td><td>$2.95</td><td>$35.40</td><td>$143.40</td><td>$11.95</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/siteground/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="SiteGround">SiteGround</a></td><td>$2.99</td><td>$35.88</td><td>$215.88</td><td>$19.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>As you can see, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bluehost">Bluehost</a> has the cheapest introductory pricing for the first year overall. This makes it easy to get started with your first website. However, you will pay more each year from your second year onwards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hostgator/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="HostGator">HostGator</a> is another good option. Their cheapest introductory rate can be used for the first three years of hosting. This will make the initial payment more expensive but is better value in the long run. Besides that, their renewal price for subsequent years is quite affordable.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/dreamhost/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="DreamHost">DreamHost</a> is a great choice if you are looking for the best cheap hosting. The introductory deal for new customers is very competitive, and the renewal price is the most affordable when paying for 12 months or more in advance.</p>
<p>DreamHost is also the best choice when paying for hosting month-to-month.</p>
<p>However, price is not the only consideration when choosing a hosting plan for your new website.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">FAQs About WordPress Hosting</h4>
<p>Over the years, we have helped over 2 million users start their websites, so we hear a lot of questions about WordPress hosting. Here are some of the answers to the most frequently asked questions about WordPress hosting.</p>
<p><strong>What are the costs of creating a new website?</strong></p>
<p>When creating a new website, you will need to pay for web hosting and a domain name. These are ongoing costs that you will need to continue paying as long as your website is live.</p>
<p>Some users may pay additional costs, such as purchasing premium plugins and themes or hiring professional developers and designers.</p>
<p>The cost of building a WordPress website depends on what you need and can range from $100 to as high as $30,000. We have created a detailed guide explaining <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-wordpress-website/" title="How Much Does It Really Cost to Build a WordPress Website?">how much it really costs to build a WordPress website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need WordPress hosting to start a new website?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you need to choose a WordPress hosting plan before you can <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/guides/" title="How to Make a WordPress Website in (Ultimate Guide)">build a WordPress website</a>. This is where your website files are stored.</p>
<p><strong>How do I install WordPress on my WordPress hosting account?</strong></p>
<p>Installing WordPress is easy. Our recommended WordPress hosting providers let you install WordPress easily with a single click.</p>
<p>You can see how this works in our guide on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/how-to-install-wordpress/" title="How to Install WordPress – Complete WordPress Installation Tutorial">how to install WordPress</a> on your host.</p>
<p><strong>Can I change to a different WordPress hosting provider in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can absolutely switch if you are unhappy with your WordPress hosting company or your needs or budget change.</p>
<p>Most WordPress hosting companies offer free migration services, which makes the process fairly smooth. However, if you want to do the migration yourself, then you can follow our step-by-step guide on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-move-wordpress-to-a-new-host-or-server-with-no-downtime/" title="How to Move WordPress to a New Host or Server With No Downtime">how to move WordPress to a new host with no downtime</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Should I use free WordPress hosting?</strong></p>
<p>No, we highly recommend that you stay away from <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-free-website-hosting-compared/" title="Best Free Website Hosting Compared">free website hosting companies</a>.</p>
<p>That’s because free hosting providers usually put advertisements on your website and in some cases may even distribute malware to your users. They may also shut down your website at any time without any notification.</p>
