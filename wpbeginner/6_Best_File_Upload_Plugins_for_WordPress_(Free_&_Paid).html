<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why Use a WordPress File Upload Plugin? </h4>
<p>By default, only users with access to your WordPress website can upload files by logging in to the dashboard. That means that if you want someone to be able to upload a file to your site, then you’d have to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-add-new-users-and-authors-to-your-wordpress-blog/" title="How to Add New Users and Authors to Your WordPress Blog">create a new user account</a> and let them log in to your website.</p>
<p>This can be time-consuming and a potential security risk.</p>
<p>That’s why accepting file uploads on the front end of your site can be super useful. Luckily, you can get this functionality with the right plugin.</p>
<p>Accepting documents, images, and other files can help you to get more information from your users when providing customer support. </p>
<p>It also makes it super easy to receive guest posts, resumes, quotations from clients, images, videos, and other content from your visitors. </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How We Test And Review WordPress File Upload Plugins</h4>
<p>To give our readers some great recommendations, we installed and tested popular file upload plugins on our website in real time. During testing, we focused on the following criteria:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> We assessed the plugin’s interface for intuitive design, ease of navigation, and overall user-friendliness.</li>
<li><strong>File upload functionality:</strong> You may want to receive different types of uploads. So, we thoroughly tested the tool’s capabilities in handling <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/webp-vs-png-vs-jpeg/" title="WebP vs. PNG vs. JPEG: The Best Image Format for WordPress">various file types</a>, sizes, and formats.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> We measured how quickly the plugin processes file uploads and whether it impacts the overall site performance.</li>
<li><strong>User Reviews:</strong> We also went through plugin reviews from actual users on WordPress.org and other trusted review sites.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong>: We evaluated every plugin in terms of value for money. We also included free options to accommodate every budget.</li>
</ul>

<p>That being said, let’s look at some of the top file upload plugins for WordPress. </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://wpforms.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="WPForms - Drag &amp; Drop WordPress Form Builder">1. WPForms</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://wpforms.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="WPForms - Drag &amp; Drop WordPress Form Builder">WPForms</a> is our first choice because it’s a powerful plugin that lets you create forms with a file upload option. We think it’s the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/5-best-contact-form-plugins-for-wordpress-compared/" title="Best Contact Form Plugins for WordPress Compared">best contact form plugin</a> for WordPress overall. Its beginner-friendly drag-and-drop builder allows you to add any type of form to your WordPress site.</p>
<p>For more information, see our complete <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/solutions/wpforms/" title="WPForms">WPForms review</a>.</p>
<p>We have consistently used WPForms to create contact forms, registration forms, and <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-a-file-upload-form-in-wordpress/" title="How to Create a File Upload Form in WordPress">file upload forms</a> across our partner brands, and it has always delivered top-tier results. Its reliability and powerful features make it a go-to solution for building forms on WordPress.</p>
<p>It also offers 1900+ prebuilt templates, each fully customizable, so you can quickly get started and add forms to your website.</p>
<p>There are two different options for file upload fields: a classic file upload for just one file or a more modern drag-and-drop file upload field that can accept multiple files at once.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="WPForms file upload field" class="wp-image-108617 perfmatters-lazy" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/wpforms-file-upload-field-example.gif" decoding="async" height="358" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='358'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20358'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="WPForms file upload field" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="WPForms file upload field" class="wp-image-108617" decoding="async" height="358" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/wpforms-file-upload-field-example.gif" title="WPForms file upload field" width="680"/></noscript></figure>
<p>With WPForms, you can <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-allow-users-to-upload-images-on-a-wordpress-site/" title="How to Allow Users to Upload Images on a WordPress Site">accept images</a>, videos, documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, presentations, and more. We also like that you can choose whether or not to save the file uploads in your WordPress media library.</p>
<p>You can also restrict different file types to keep your website safe and increase the maximum upload size so you can accept larger files if needed.</p>
<p>Besides file uploads, WPForms also offers spam protection, multi-page forms, and conditional logic, making it an amazing choice.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>During testing, we discovered that the plugin lets you fully customize your forms. You can change the background color, form field colors, button colors, and more.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It is also compatible with different email marketing services and payment services to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-easily-accept-credit-card-payments-on-your-wordpress-site/" title="How to Easily Accept Credit Card Payments on Your WordPress Site">create online payment and donation forms</a>. Our experience with these features has shown that they significantly boost form usability and effectiveness.</li>
<li>WPForms sends you a notification when a form is submitted.</li>
<li>We love its form analytics feature, which lets you track form entries and user journeys.</li>
<li>The plugin also comes with A/B testing functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>WPForms has a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Free version of WPForms Contact Form builder plugin">free plan</a>, but you will need the pro version to unlock some features.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why we recommend WPForms: </strong>As the most powerful form builder, WPForms is the best choice for creating a file upload form. It is beginner-friendly, offers numerous form fields, and connects with multiple third-party tools.</p>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/file-upload-types/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="File Upload Types by WPForm">File Upload Types by WPForms</a> is a free file upload plugin for WordPress. It lets you accept additional file types in WordPress which aren’t available by default. </p>
<p>We tested this tool ourselves and found it to be super user-friendly. Thanks to its seamless integration, it can help streamline the way you collect files from visitors.</p>
<p>WordPress allows specific file extensions for your users’ uploads. If someone tries to upload content outside the permitted file types, they are shown an error message saying, ‘Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons.’</p>
<p>To <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-fix-sorry-this-file-type-is-not-permitted-for-security-reasons-error-in-wordpress/" title="How to Fix “Sorry, This File Type Is Not Permitted for Security Reasons” Error in WordPress">fix the error</a>, you can use the File Upload Types by WPForms plugin.</p>

<p>It allows users to manage which file extensions are permitted on their website from the WordPress dashboard. Simply enable or disable the extensions from your WordPress admin area.</p>
<p>The plugin lets you add some common file extensions to WordPress, including .zip, .ai, .xml, .svg, .csv, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We like that it allows users to upload multiple files at once.</li>
<li>You can also <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-add-a-progress-bar-in-your-wordpress-posts/" title="How to Add a Progress Bar in Your WordPress Posts (The Easy Way)">display a progress bar</a> to indicate the file upload status.</li>
<li>During our investigation, we found that the plugin can integrate with services like Dropbox to store file uploads directly on the cloud.</li>
<li>It is completely free.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>When testing the tool, we observed that it doesn’t have any front-end file upload form. That’s why it must be used with WPForms or other plugins on our list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why we recommend File Upload Types by WPForms:</strong> If you want to accept additional file types with your file upload form, then this is a great complement to your preferred form plugin.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Frequently Asked Questions: WordPress File Upload Plugins</h4>
<p>Here are some frequently asked questions from our readers about file upload plugins.</p>
<p><strong>What are the main differences between free and paid file upload plugins?</strong></p>
<p>The main differences between free and paid file upload plugins for WordPress come down to features and flexibility.</p>
<p>Free plugins often offer basic functionalities, like simple file uploads and limited customization options. They are ideal for users with straightforward needs and smaller budgets. </p>
<p>On the other hand, paid plugins have advanced features such as larger file size limits, better security, file management tools, and integrations with cloud storage services like <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-back-up-a-wordpress-site-to-dropbox/" title="How to Back up a WordPress Site to Dropbox (Step by Step)">Dropbox</a> or Google Drive.</p>
<p>They also offer better support, regular updates, and greater customization, making them a better choice for businesses with more complex requirements.</p>
<p><strong>What are some common issues with file upload plugins?</strong></p>
<p>Common issues with file upload plugins can include compatibility problems with certain themes or other plugins, leading to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/common-wordpress-errors-and-how-to-fix-them/" title="Most Common WordPress Errors and How to Fix Them">errors on your site</a>.</p>
<p>Users may also face file size limitations, especially with free plugins, which can restrict the types or sizes of files that can be uploaded. </p>
<p>Security is another concern because improper configuration can leave your site vulnerable to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-wordpress-vulnerability-scanners-online/" title="Best WordPress Security Scanners for Detecting Malware and Hacks">malware</a>. Additionally, users might experience slow upload speeds or difficulties in managing uploaded files if the plugin doesn’t offer strong file management features.</p>
<p><strong>How can I ensure the security of file uploads on my WordPress website?</strong></p>
<p>To ensure the security of file uploads on your WordPress website, you can start by using a reliable file upload plugin that has built-in security features. For instance, <a href="https://wpforms.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="WPForms - Drag &amp; Drop WordPress Form Builder">WPForms</a> has built-in spam protection and allows you to add CAPTCHA to your forms.</p>
<p>Other than that, you should restrict file types to allow only specific formats, which helps prevent malicious files from being uploaded. You can also implement a maximum file size limit to reduce the risk of large files that could harm your site.</p>
<p>You can even use a firewall plugin to provide an extra layer of security by filtering out harmful traffic. To learn more about security practices, see our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/" title="The Ultimate WordPress Security Guide – Step by Step">ultimate WordPress security guide</a>.</p>
