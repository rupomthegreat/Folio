<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-how-we-review-transcription-services">How We Review Transcription Services</h4>
<p>Our evaluation process for transcription services is thorough and objective. It focuses on four key factors: ease of use, language support, accuracy, and turnaround time.</p>
<p>We checked the user interface, upload process, and overall user experience to ensure the service is accessible for both beginners and experienced users.</p>
<p>Then, we looked at the range of languages and dialects supported, as well as the quality of transcription for non-English content.</p>
<p>In terms of accuracy, we looked at audio samples, including different accents and background noise levels, to see if the transcription is accurate across different scenarios.</p>
<p>Finally, we reviewed how quickly each service delivers transcriptions, considering both automated and human-powered options.</p>

<p>Now, we’ll share some of the best transcription services on the market today. </p>
<p>Ready? Let’s get started.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-1-rev"><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/rev/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Rev">1. Rev</a></h4>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/rev/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Rev" class="wp-image-157875 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rev.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rev.jpg 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rev-300x159.jpg 300w" decoding="async" height="360" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='680'%20height='360'%20viewBox='0%200%20680%20360'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Rev" width="680"/><noscript><img alt="Rev" class="wp-image-157875" decoding="async" height="360" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rev.jpg" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rev.jpg 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rev-300x159.jpg 300w" title="Rev" width="680"/></noscript></a></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/rev/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Rev">Rev</a> is a transcription service provider that offers a range of different transcription-related services.</p>
<p>When reviewing the service, we found support for audio transcriptions, video transcriptions, captions, subtitles, and translations for a wide range of audio and video files.</p>
<p>Rev is by far the best transcription service when it comes to error rate and transcription speed. While we think it’s not the fastest provider, it’s fast enough to provide nearly perfect text.</p>
<p>Now, easy transcriptions can generally be completed in a few hours, with an accuracy rate of 99%.</p>
<p>This is a unique service because they have human transcribers that utilize speech recognition AI. This gives you the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Plus, all transcriptions done through this service are FCC and ADA-approved and meet section 508 requirements. So, your transcriptions will be fully compliant with accessibility guidelines.</p>
<p>Beyond transcriptions, captioning, and subtitles, we appreciate the unique feature that provides live captions for Zoom meetings and webinars.</p>
<p>This ensures your meetings and online presentations are accessible to all.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature Rev provides is support for foreign subtitles. If you have an international audience, you can create multi-language subtitles for all the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-video-editing-software/" title="Best Video Editing Software Compared (Easy &amp; Powerful)">videos you edit</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-mobile-apps-to-manage-your-wordpress-site/" title="Best Mobile Apps to Manage Your WordPress Site">mobile app</a> for iPhone and Android. It lets you capture your ideas, meetings, lectures, and more on the go. Then, you can transcribe your audio with a single click from the app.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/rev/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Rev">Rev</a> transcriptions start at $1.50 per minute and $0.25 per minute for a machine-generated transcript with 90%+ accuracy.</p>
<p>Rush transcripts are available for an extra dollar per audio or video minute and will be completed five times faster.</p>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rev guarantees 99% accuracy </li>
<li>Fast turnaround times within 24 hours </li>
<li>Offers transcription, captioning, and translation services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Costs can add up for long-form content</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why We Recommend Using Rev: </strong>We like Rev because it offers a wide range of services, such as transcriptions, video captioning, and translations. You can also choose its AI service, which is another affordable option.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-2-scribie"><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/scribie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Scribie">2. Scribie</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/scribie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Scribie">Scribie</a> is a great transcription provider that offers both automated and manual transcription services. With this service, you can get a wide range of features and transcription options for any budget.</p>
<p>We found that the manual transcription service is 99% accurate and has a 36-hour turnaround. Also, adding a subtitle file, time coding, strict verbatim, speaker tracking, and more are easy.</p>
<p>You can track the progress of your transcription and even download versions as they’re completed. This can be very handy when you need a working version of the document to use right away.</p>
<p>The company also stands behind the quality of its transcripts. If you’re not satisfied with the quality, then you can ask for a free re-review that’ll have a quick one-day turnaround.</p>
<p>Our overall impression was that the transcription process with Scribie is super easy. All you have to do is upload your file, choose your plan, make a payment, and you’ll get a Word file back in your selected timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/scribie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Scribie">Scribie</a> pricing starts at $0.80 per minute for manual transcription and $0.10 per minute for automated transcription.</p>
<p>There’s an additional fee of $0.50 per minute for files where the speaker has an accent, the audio file is of poor quality, or background noise is present.</p>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Competitive pricing </li>
<li>Easy-to-use editing software </li>
<li>Nearly perfect transcriptions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Confusing web interface </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why We Recommend Scribie: </strong>Scribie checks each transcript several times to make sure it’s accurate. This method is really helpful for recordings that are hard to hear or have complicated content.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/gotranscript/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="GoTranscript">GoTranscript</a> is one of the most accurate transcription services. It provides very accurate transcriptions for audio files with hard-to-understand accents. Plus, it supports 48 different languages and files with multiple accents in a single audio file.</p>
<p>If your audio is hard to decipher, has a lot of background noise, or is otherwise low quality, it’s worth testing out GoTranscript.</p>
<p>It does a great job at handling complex projects, like STEM, academic, and technical papers, too.</p>
<p>During testing, we noticed that there’s a quick turnaround, especially considering its manual transcription for complex and in-depth topics.</p>
<p>However, if you’re not located in Britain, then the timing can be different since time quotes are based on their time zones.</p>
<p>The pricing is pretty affordable, considering the accuracy of the transcription you’ll be getting.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/gotranscript/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="GoTranscript">GoTranscript</a> starts at $0.90 per audio minute. You can get discounts on bulk orders, like 2500+ mins audio requiring transcription.</p>
<p>Pricing increases for fast turnaround, low-quality audio, number of speakers, and your language preference.</p>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>High accuracy rates of 99%</li>
<li>Supports multiple languages </li>
<li>Strong security protocols to protect client data </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Mobile app is limited</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why We Recommend GoTranscript: </strong>We like GoTranscript as one of the best services for getting human-generated transcription in different languages or specific industries. </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-4-sonix"><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/sonix/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Sonix">4. Sonix</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/sonix/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Sonix">Sonix</a> is a fully automated AI transcription software. Since it’s AI-based, it’s incredibly fast, and you won’t have to wait on human transcribers.</p>
<p>But this also means you won’t get the same level of accuracy as human transcription. Still, the easy-to-use editing tools and low price can balance this out.</p>
<p>Our research revealed that you can use the in-browser editor to polish your transcript. It has features like word-by-word timestamps, commenting and notes for you and your team, speaker labeling, multiple export options, and more.</p>
<p>You’ll also find tools for automated translation, subtitles, and collaboration features. Plus, there are plenty of integrations with tools you already use, like Zoom, Vimeo, YouTube, Dropbox, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/sonix/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Sonix">Sonix</a> pricing starts at $10 per hour of audio, which is just under $0.17 per audio minute.</p>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Excellent customer service </li>
<li>Closed captions appear in real time</li>
<li>Easy to fix any errors </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons: </strong></p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-what-is-the-best-transcription-service-for-you">What Is the Best Transcription Service?</h4>
<p>After reviewing all the most popular transcription services, we believe that <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/rev/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Rev">Rev</a> is the best transcription service.</p>
<p>The transcription quality is 99% accurate, and the turnaround is pretty fast with affordable pricing.</p>
<p>You can use it to transcribe your YouTube videos and podcasts, add captions, and there’s even support for foreign language subtitling.</p>
<p>Another great choice is <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/scribie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Scribie">Scribie</a>, which offers fast and accurate transcriptions at an affordable rate.</p>
<p>In addition to the top transcription services on our list, we also looked at other transcription providers, such as Temi, TranscribeMe, Trint, and iScribed.</p>
<p>However, we decided not to list them to help make your choice as easy as possible and avoid decision paralysis.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-best-transcription-services-faqs">Best Transcription Services FAQs</h4>
<p>While helping our readers find the best transcription services for their needs, we’ve answered a lot of questions.</p>
<p>Below are some of the most frequently asked questions we’ve received about online transcription providers.</p>
<p><strong>1. What is the going rate for transcribing?</strong></p>
<p>In general, the standard rate for transcribing is between $0.10 and $1.50 per audio minute.</p>
<p>The rate you pay will depend on the audio quality, accents present, whether or not it’s human or AI transcription, and more.</p>
<p>Overall, the more you pay per audio minute, the higher the quality of the finished transcription will be.</p>
<p><strong>2. How long does it take to transcribe 1 hour of audio?</strong></p>
<p>Typically, it takes individual transcriptionists 4 hours to transcribe 1 hour of audio. This will differ based on the transcriber’s skill, whether they use AI or the audio file’s quality.</p>
<p>Different transcription services have different turnaround times based on what you pay and if you require rush delivery.</p>
<p><strong>3. What is the best free transcription software?</strong></p>
<p>Some of the best free transcription software include the Google Docs dictation feature and automatic YouTube transcriptions that can be downloaded after a video is uploaded.</p>
<p>However, the big issue with free transcription apps and software is they aren’t going to be that accurate.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for the cheapest option, then <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/rev/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Rev">Rev</a> has a free trial that allows you to test out 30 minutes of audio for free.</p>
<p>If the quality is up to your standards, then the paid plans start at $1.50 per audio minute.</p>
<p><strong>4. What should you look for in a transcription service? </strong></p>
<p>Not all transcription services are equal. Some use human transcription services (which usually cost more), while others use an AI service. While AI isn’t always as accurate, the quality is certainly improving over time. </p>
<p>Another thing to consider is the turnaround time. Obviously, AI services can easily transcribe an entire clip into a document in a few minutes, while human services may take a few days. </p>
<p>You’ll also need to factor into the time limits on transcriptions, as many popular services have limits on how many files you can transcribe per month and the length of each file. All in all, make sure to consider your needs and use case before you decide on which transcription service is right for you. </p>
