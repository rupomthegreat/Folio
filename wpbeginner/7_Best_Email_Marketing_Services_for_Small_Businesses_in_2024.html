<p>We have used several email marketing services listed in this article for a long time on our various online businesses (publishing and eCommerce). This includes MailChimp, Drip, Kit, Constant Contact, and HubSpot.</p>
<p>We have first-hand experience with these email marketing platforms, and know the pros, cons, and features that suit different types of businesses.</p>
<p>For other email services, we signed up for accounts, so that we could test the features for creating emails, segmenting contacts, setting up automation, and actually sending emails.</p>
<p>Along the way, we looked for services that are easy to use for beginners, offer automation options for eCommerce, and have fair pricing for small businesses.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/constant-contact/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Constant Contact">Constant Contact</a> is our #1 choice for an email marketing service. We used it on our test site and recommend it to anyone especially those who are <strong>starting out with an email list.</strong> </p>
<p>From our test, we found that it <strong>offers great beginner-friendly features</strong> so you can send error-free and stunning emails with confidence. </p>
<p>For example, it offers 300+ email templates to choose from, which makes building a stunning email easy. Unlike other platforms, it checks for common beginner errors in the email, like template placeholder text and missing links, and even offers subject line recommendations. </p>
<p>Each account gives you unlimited emails, easy tracking and reporting, built-in social media sharing tools, a free image library, list segmentation, Facebook ads integration, and a powerful eCommerce integration for <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/opinion/shopify-vs-woocommerce-which-is-the-better-platform-comparison/" title="Shopify vs WooCommerce - Which is Better and Why? ">Shopify</a> stores.</p>
<p>Their Email Plus accounts also have powerful features like email automation, drip campaigns, surveys &amp; polls, coupons, online donations, and subject line A/B testing, which helps you send targeted emails to maximize your open rate.</p>
<p>We particularly like that Constant Contact has unmatched customer support with live chat, phone calls, email, community support, and a vast library of helpful resources.</p>
<p>Aside from online training, they also offer in-person live seminars across the United States. This allows small business owners to quickly learn the basics of email marketing and start using it to grow their business like a pro.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/brevo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Brevo">Brevo</a>, formerly known as Sendinblue, is a complete SMS, CRM, automation, and email marketing software for businesses like yours. </p>
<p>What we really like about Brevo is that they offer a <strong>free plan for up to 100,000 contacts</strong>. </p>
<p>Although they offer an easy-to-use platform, compared to Constant Contact, they offer a limited number of email templates to choose from (Just around 40+, while Constant Contact offers 300+ templates). Plus, Brevo doesn’t offer live chat support and phone support is not free.</p>
<p>However, if you’re looking for a platform that offers free plan, Brevo could be the best bet. </p>
<p>They also offer advanced features including a landing page builder, live chat, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-crm-software-for-small-businesses-compared/" title="7 Best CRM Apps for Small Businesses (With Free Options)">sales CRM</a>, and Facebook ads integration. This means users now get more value for the same price.</p>
<p>Brevo also offers a separate SMTP bulk email marketing service, which you can use to power automated or transactional emails from your WordPress site. You do not need this for email marketing campaigns, but it’s a nice functionality to have if you have a large website and want automatic real-time content-based emails.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of Brevo Email Marketing Service</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Brevo comes with a drag-and-drop email editor and a simple user interface.</li>
<li>It offers advanced automation tools to create user workflows and segmentation.</li>
<li>It uses AI to send bulk emails, ensuring enhanced email deliverability and open rates.</li>
<li>Brevo has additional features like live chat, sales CRM, and Facebook ads integration, making it a powerful solution.</li>
<li>With its SMTP service, it lets you send automated and transactional emails easily.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons of Brevo Email Marketing Service</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It comes with a free plan, but it only allows 300 emails per day, making it too limited for businesses looking into this option.</li>
<li>It can become expensive for high-volume emails, multi-user access, and advanced features.</li>
<li>Limited live chat and phone support, depending on your plan.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why do we recommend the Brevo email marketing service?</strong></p>
<p>We recommend <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/brevo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Brevo(Formerly Sendinblue)">Brevo</a> for its user-friendly design combined with powerful tools, making it suitable for beginners and professionals. It comes with AI-driven bulk email timing for optimized deliverability and advanced features like a landing page builder and CRM. Additionally, we like its separate <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-smtp-service-providers-with-high-email-deliverability/" title="Best SMTP Service Providers with High Email Deliverability">SMTP service</a> for real-time transactional emails, making email delivery reliable.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Brevo offers a completely free email marketing plan with unlimited contacts. Their free plan lets you send up to 300 emails per day, but all your emails will have their branding.</p>
<p>The paid plans start from $9 per month for Starter. You can also include SMS on your account, but the pricing will vary based on your sending requirements.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hubspot-email-marketing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="HubSpot Email Marketing">HubSpot</a> is one of the most well-known software in the customer relationship management (CRM) and email marketing space.</p>
<p>Their email marketing service is free to start and comes with many advanced automation features designed to grow your business. You can use the easy drag-and-drop email builder and a selection of templates to create a completely custom newsletter that matches your brand’s personality and colors.</p>
<p>Because of the native integration with the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hubspot-crm/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="HubSpot CRM">HubSpot CRM</a>, you can personalize your emails for each subscriber based on things like device type, country, list membership, or any other custom information you might have on the individual subscriber.</p>
<p>HubSpot comes with all the powerful features you’d expect from enterprise-level email marketing software, such as send time optimization, high email deliverability, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-ab-split-testing-in-wordpress-using-google-analytics/" title="How to Do A/B Split Testing in WordPress Using Google Optimize">A/B testing</a>, detailed performance analytics, marketing automation, drip campaigns, and more.</p>
<p>We would recommend HubSpot for small, medium, and enterprise customers because it offers an all-in-one marketing platform with email marketing, CRM, automation workflows, sales tools, a website builder, an operation hub, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Pros of HubSpot Email Marketing Service</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It’s an all-in-one solution that includes email marketing service, CRM, automation workflows, sales tools, and more.</li>
<li>HubSpot CRM allows you to create highly personalized email campaigns based on detailed subscriber data.</li>
<li>It has a drag and drop email builder and several email templates to design custom newsletters without advanced technical skills.</li>
<li>It provides detailed analytics and insights, including A/B testing results, to help you optimize your email marketing campaigns.</li>
<li>The free plan includes HubSpot CRM and email marketing tools, which are a great combination for small businesses trying to build their presence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons of HubSpot Email Marketing Service</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>HubSpot is a good service for small businesses, but it becomes expensive when you try to scale up.</li>
<li>It has several tools integrated within each other, making it a bit confusing for beginners.</li>
<li>It can be challenging to integrate HubSpot with third-party tools.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why do we recommend HubSpot email marketing service?</strong></p>
<p>We recommend HubSpot email marketing service for its seamless integration with the HubSpot CRM and other tools. Plus, it offers advanced automation features, A/B testing, and high deliverability.

<p>Kit’s most unique feature is that it allows you to easily offer <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-content-upgrades-in-wordpress-and-grow-your-email-list/" title="How to Add Content Upgrades in WordPress and Grow Your Email List">content upgrades</a> and incentives with email signup forms. It also comes with easy-to-manage auto-responders, allowing you to send drip emails from their emailing service.</p>
<p>With Kit, you can easily segment subscribers into those who are interested and those who have already purchased. This helps you increase conversions with automated emails that feel more personal. In marketing terms, this is called targeted email marketing.</p>
<p>It has all the powerful features you’d expect from a top-notch email marketing service, such as A/B testing, beautiful email templates, a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/best-wordpress-landing-page-plugins-compared/" title="6 Best WordPress Landing Page Plugins Compared">landing page builder</a>, smart workflows, and more.</p>
<p>Kit offers email-based support and has an extensive knowledge base with great learning material.</p>
<p>A lot of Kit features, such as <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-a-paid-newsletter-in-wordpress/" title="How to Create a Paid Newsletter in WordPress (Substack Alternative)">paid newsletters</a>, are specifically designed for creators and professional bloggers, which is why we rate them the best email marketing service for professional bloggers.</p>
<p>You even have the ability to sell digital products &amp; subscriptions from the same platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/convertkit/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kit">Kit</a> offers a free plan with limited features for up to 10,000 subscribers. Pricing starts from $9/month (paid annually), depending on the number of subscribers you have. There is also a 30-day refund policy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/mailchimp/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="MailChimp">Mailchimp</a> is one of the most popular email marketing service providers in the world primarily because it offers a forever-free email marketing service plan.</p>
<p>Although we no longer recommend it since there are better solutions available on the market, the sad reality is that we cannot create the best email marketing software list without including Mailchimp due to its sheer popularity.</p>
<p>Mailchimp comes with an easy drag-and-drop email builder, autoresponders, segmenting contacts into groups, and simple <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-set-up-email-newsletter-tracking-in-google-analytics/" title="How to Set Up Email Newsletter Tracking in Google Analytics">email tracking</a> for analytics. It also allows you to set up delivery times based on the user’s time zone, and you can set up segmenting based on geolocation.</p>
<p>You can easily integrate MailChimp with WordPress, Magento, Shopify, and many other platforms. </p>
<p>If you are using WordPress, then see our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/ultimate-guide-to-using-mailchimp-and-wordpress/" title="Ultimate Guide to Using Mailchimp and WordPress">ultimate guide to using Mailchimp and WordPress</a> for detailed instructions, or check out our picks of the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-wordpress-mailchimp-plugins/" title="17 Best WordPress Mailchimp Plugins">best Mailchimp plugins</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to marketing automation features, the Mailchimp platform is quite limited when compared to other providers in our list such as <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hubspot-email-marketing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="HubSpot Email Marketing">HubSpot</a>, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/drip/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Drip">Drip</a>, or <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/convertkit/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kit (Formerly ConvertKit)">Kit</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years, Mailchimp has attempted to add many of the “advanced” features found in other platforms, but after testing many of these, we believe that they are not truly advanced.</p>
<p>Mailchimp support is offered via email, live chat, and a large tutorial knowledge base. However, their support is often slow and does not match the quality of service that you get from <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/constant-contact/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Constant Contact">Constant Contact</a>.</p>
<p>Their paid plans start from $13/month, and the pricing increases based on the number of subscribers in your audience.</p>
<p>However, if you want unlimited audiences, advanced audience segmentation, multivariate testing, and comparative reporting, then you’d have to move to their $350/month plan.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-final-thoughts-the-best-email-marketing-service">Final Thoughts: The Best Email Marketing Service</h4>
<p>There are many other email marketing services available, but we want to make sure that you choose the right one for your business needs.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-bonus-tip-improve-your-email-deliverability">Bonus Tip: Improve Your Email Deliverability</h4>
<p>All the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-create-an-email-newsletter/" title="How to Create an Email Newsletter the RIGHT Way (Step by Step)">email newsletter</a> tools that we have shared in this article have great email deliverability rates.</p>
<p>However, there are a few things you can do to make sure that your marketing emails always get delivered.</p>
<p><strong>1. Use a Professional Email Address</strong></p>
<p>Email platforms like Gmail, Outlook, and others have algorithms that look for spammy behavior. One of them is the sender’s email address.</p>
<p>As a business, it’s important that you use a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-create-a-free-business-email-address-in-5-minutes-step-by-step/" title="How to Create a Free Business Email Address in 5 Minutes (Step by Step)">professional business email address</a> (like yourname@yourcompany.com) and not a generic hotmail or gmail address.</p>
<p>This will help make sure that your email deliverability rate is higher than the industry average.</p>
<p><strong>2. Send Targeted Emails Based on Interests</strong></p>
<p>It’s very important that you personalize your emails based on user segments. Email marketing software like <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/constant-contact/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Constant Contact">Constant Contact</a> and <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hubspot-email-marketing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="HubSpot Email Marketing">HubSpot</a> allows you to easily group your subscribers into segments such as most active, not-active, interested in specific topics, custom segments, etc.</p>
<p>This will help your email marketing campaigns have the highest open and click-through rates, which are big factors in future email deliverability.</p>
<p>We always recommend sending a personalized welcome email to all new subscribers and then segmenting users according to their interests.</p>
<p>It’s also important to have a clear unsubscribe link for users so they can unsubscribe rather than marking your emails as spam.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-email-marketing-software-faqs">Email Marketing Software FAQs</h4>
<p>Having helped thousands of users pick the best email marketing software, we have answered quite a lot of questions. Below are some of the answers to the most frequently asked questions about email marketing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Can I do bulk email marketing from my Gmail or Outlook?</strong></p>
<p>In theory, yes. But this will quickly get your email accounts suspended. <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/google-apps-work/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Google Apps for Work">G Suite</a> and <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/office-365/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Office 365">Outlook</a> are not made for bulk email sending. They are great solutions for <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-create-a-free-business-email-address-in-5-minutes-step-by-step/" title="How to Create a Free Business Email Address in 5 Minutes (Step by Step)">professional business emails</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Which is the best free email marketing service?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of email marketing services will offer free tiers for limited use. The best free email marketing service is <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/brevo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Brevo">Brevo</a> (formerly known as Sendinblue) because its free plan doesn’t limit the number of subscribers. <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hubspot-email-marketing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="HubSpot Email Marketing">HubSpot</a>, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/omnisend/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Omnisend">Omnisend</a>, and <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/mailchimp/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="MailChimp">MailChimp</a> also offer free email marketing service plans.</p>
<p><strong>How much does email marketing cost?</strong></p>
<p>Your email marketing cost will entirely depend on the number of subscribers you have, the number of total emails you send per month, and the email platform you use. On average, a small business’s email marketing costs around $20 – $300 per month if they manage their own campaigns. If you use an email marketing agency, then your cost might be closer to $500 per month or higher.</p>
<p><strong>Can email marketing help with SEO? </strong></p>
<p>Email marketing has no direct impact on SEO. However, it can help you <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-increase-your-blog-traffic/" title="How to Increase Your Blog Traffic – The Easy Way (27 Proven Tips)">get more traffic</a> to your website, which can lead to more shares and sometimes backlinks / mentions.</p>
<p>Google and other search engines use shares and mentions as social signals to rank websites. So indirectly, email marketing can help your website’s SEO rankings.</p>
<p>You may also want to use these <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/9-best-wordpress-seo-plugins-and-tools-that-you-should-use/" title="14 Best WordPress SEO Plugins and Tools That You Should Use">best WordPress SEO plugins and tools</a> to improve your rankings.</p>
<p><strong>Which is the best email marketing app for Shopify?</strong></p>
<p>Many of the above email marketing services offer an intuitive Shopify app that’s easy to use. We recommend using either <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/omnisend/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Omnisend">Omnisend</a> or <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/drip/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Drip">Drip</a> since they offer robust eCommerce marketing automation tools that seamlessly integrate with both Shopify and WooCommerce.</p>
<p>Some eCommerce power users prefer Klaviyo for Shopify email marketing, but their platform is quite expensive for small businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Which is the best email marketing platform for WordPress?</strong></p>
<p>Most email marketing platforms have deep integration with WordPress because it’s the most <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-choose-the-best-website-builder/" title="How to Choose the Best Website Builder (Compared)">popular website builder</a> on the planet, powering over 43% of all websites. With that said, the best email marketing platforms for WordPress are <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/constant-contact/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Constant Contact">Constant Contact</a>, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/brevo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="Brevo (Formerly Sendinblue)">Brevo</a>, and <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/hubspot-email-marketing/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="HubSpot Email Marketing">HubSpot</a>. </p>
<p>Over the last few years, many business owners have also switched to native WordPress email marketing solutions like <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/funnelkit-marketing-automation-engine-crm/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="FunnelKit Automations">FunnelKit Automations.</a> These solutions help you save big on costs while offering powerful features like <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/what-is-an-email-blast-how-to-do-an-email-blast-the-right-way/" title="What is An Email Blast? How to Do An Email Blast 'The RIGHT Way' ">broadcast emails</a>, automated drip emails, CRM, and more right from inside WordPress. </p>
<p>Website owners use FunnelKit for creating emails and then use the <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="WP Mail SMTP - Fix WordPress Email Deliverability">WP Mail SMTP plugin</a> along with an SMTP service like <a href="https://sendlayer.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="SendLayer - Reliable Email Deliverability Made Easy">SendLayer</a>, Amazon SES, SendGrid, or others to ensure that all emails reliably reach customers’ inboxes.</p>
<p><strong>Are there other email marketing platforms that are not listed here?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there are literally hundreds of email marketing services out there, but we have not listed them all here. We believe that making a full list of email platforms would create more confusion and cause choice paralysis for non-techy readers.</p>
<p>We have tried all the top major email marketing services, including many that are not in our email platform lists above, such as: <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/mailerlite/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="MailerLite">MailerLite</a>, ActiveCampaign, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/getresponse/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="GetResponse">GetResponse</a>, Ontraport, Mailjet, Benchmark, Campaign Monitor, InfusionSoft (now Keap), Klaviyo, Marketo, Eloqua, Pardot by Salesforce, Sendloop, iContact, Emma, TotalSend, SharpSpring, MailPoet, Email Octopus, Sendy, and more.</p>
