<p>Understanding your customers is key to growing a successful online store. The right WooCommerce reporting and analytics plugins can help you dive into essential data to boost sales and refine your strategies.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How We Test &amp; Review WooCommerce Reporting Plugins</h4>
<p>Wondering how we picked the WooCommerce reporting plugins featured in this list? We’ll go over our process now.</p>
<p>When reviewing each WooCommerce reporting and analytics plugin, we first looked at its ease of use.</p>
<p>Not everyone is a tech expert, so we looked for plugins with user-friendly dashboards, clear instructions, and intuitive settings. That way, tracking your WooCommerce store’s performance will be much more manageable.</p>
<p>Being able to customize your reports to show the exact information you need is a big plus. The more flexible the reporting, the better you can tailor it to your online store needs. So, we also favored tools that offer this option. </p>
<p>Here are other factors we took into consideration:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Metrics and reporting features</strong>. Different plugins offer different types of data and reports. Some may focus on basic sales metrics like revenue and conversion rates, while others provide more in-depth insights like <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-enable-customer-tracking-in-woocommerce-with-google-analytics/" title="How to Enable Customer Tracking in WooCommerce with Google Analytics">customer behavior</a>, cart activity, and marketing campaign results. We made sure to evaluate every plugin’s features as a whole.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time data tracking</strong>. We looked for real-time tracking tools for users who want to closely monitor their store’s activity. With real-time monitoring, you can see what’s happening as it happens, whether you want to track a flash sale or the effects of a new campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with other tools</strong>. We reviewed how these plugins work with other popular tools like Google Analytics, CRM systems, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-email-marketing-services/" title="Best Email Marketing Services for Small Businesses">email marketing software</a>, and more. That way, you can easily share data across different platforms or track all your stats in one place.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Features</strong>. We looked for standout features that could give your store an extra advantage. This could include things like automated email workflows or <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-woocommerce-sales-funnel-plugins/" title="Best WooCommerce Sales Funnel Plugins to Boost Your Conversions">sales funnels</a>. Advanced features can make a big difference in how effectively you can grow your store.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Impact. </strong>Some plugins may slow down your website if they are resource-heavy. With this in mind, we checked whether plugins were <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-performance-speed/" title="The Ultimate Guide to Boost WordPress Speed &amp; Performance">optimized for performance</a> so they don’t impact your site speed or user experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally,<strong> we have used some of these plugins in our own stores</strong>. We’ve integrated multiple WooCommerce analytics plugins to manage our sales, inventory, and customer insights.</p>
<p><strong>We also tested the most popular ones</strong> to ensure you get the best recommendations. Every plugin was graded based on factors such as accuracy of data, ease of integration, comprehensiveness of reports, real-time analytics capabilities, and affordability.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>we categorized them based on specific eCommerce needs</strong>. Not every <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-start-an-online-store/" title="How to Start an Online Store (Step by Step)">online store</a> has the same requirements. Whether you’re a small startup or a growing enterprise, there’s something for you on this list.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why Do You Need a WooCommerce Reporting Plugin?</h4>
<p>Before we dive in, let’s talk about why you need a WooCommerce reporting plugin.</p>
<p>WooCommerce is the world’s most popular <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-free-ecommerce-platforms/" title="Best Free Ecommerce Platforms (Compared)">eCommerce platform</a>. It’s a free eCommerce plugin for WordPress that makes it super easy to sell products and services online.</p>
<p>If you’re running a WooCommerce store, then it’s important to know how well it’s performing. You should be able to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-setup-woocommerce-conversion-tracking/" title="How to Setup WooCommerce Conversion Tracking (Step by Step)">track your conversions</a>, find out where your customers are from, and uncover which marketing strategies are working.</p>
<p>However, WooCommerce only offers very basic analytics metrics by default.</p>
<p>So, to find out all of this and more, you’ll need a WooCommerce reporting plugin. It will help you get insights into how customers use your website. That way, you can offer the products and services they like the most.</p>
<p>Besides that, you can use a WooCommerce reporting and analytics tool to measure your marketing campaigns and discover where potential customers are leaving your site before they complete a purchase.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at some of the best WooCommerce reporting and analytics plugins.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.monsterinsights.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="MonsterInsights - WordPress Analytics Plugin">1. MonsterInsights</a></h4>

<p>The MonsterInsights eCommerce report lets you view your revenue, number of transactions, conversion rate, and average order value at a glance.</p>
<p>MonsterInsights also shows the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-choose-the-best-products-to-sell-online-beginners-guide/" title="How to Choose the Best Products to Sell Online (Beginner’s Guide)">most popular products</a> on your WooCommerce store and helps you find out which products generate the most sales and revenue.</p>

<p>Using this information, you can offer similar products and services that your customers prefer and grow your eCommerce revenue.</p>
<p>We also like that the plugin <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-track-website-visitors-to-your-wordpress-site/" title="How to Track Website Visitors to Your WordPress Site">tracks your top conversion sources</a> so you can see which websites are sending you high-converting traffic. This helps you to invest more in marketing strategies that are already proven to work.</p>
<p>Then, you can view more shopper behavior reports in your WordPress dashboard. For instance, MonsterInsights shows you the total items added to the cart, removed from the cart, time to purchase, and sessions to purchase a product.</p>
<p>What’s more, it’s simple to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-get-ga4-site-annotations-and-notes-in-wordpress/" title="How to Get GA4 Site Annotations and Notes in WordPress">add annotations</a> to your MonsterInsights reports when you make key changes to your site, like publishing a new landing page, running an ad campaign, or adding a new product. This makes it easier to track which events make an impact on your website traffic.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Add and view site notes in MonsterInsights" class="wp-image-309815 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/viewing-notes-under-the-report-min.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/viewing-notes-under-the-report-min.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/viewing-notes-under-the-report-min-300x148.png 300w" decoding="async" height="271" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='550'%20height='271'%20viewBox='0%200%20550%20271'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Add and view site notes in MonsterInsights" width="550"/><noscript><img alt="Add and view site notes in MonsterInsights" class="wp-image-309815" decoding="async" height="271" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/viewing-notes-under-the-report-min.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/viewing-notes-under-the-report-min.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/viewing-notes-under-the-report-min-300x148.png 300w" title="Add and view site notes in MonsterInsights" width="550"/></noscript></figure>

<p><a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="WP Mail SMTP - Fix WordPress Email Deliverability">WP Mail SMTP</a> is a must if your WooCommerce store sends emails (which it probably does). That’s because it ensures that all your emails reach your customers’ inboxes. We’ve included it on this list because it also offers essential email tracking and reporting features.</p>
<p>We use it ourselves to improve email deliverability on our site. Plus, we did a deep dive into its features, which you can see in our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/solutions/wp-mail-smtp/" title="WP Mail SMTP">WP Mail SMTP review</a>.</p>
<p>In our opinion, WP Mail SMTP is essential for all online stores because they send out tons of emails by design. Think about it, you’ll need to send customers receipts of their purchases, order details, user account information, order confirmation emails, and much more.</p>
<p>If your customers aren’t getting these important emails, then it will result in a bad user experience, and you’ll lose potential customers.</p>
<p>With WP Mail SMTP, you can track whether your emails are being delivered or not. All you have to do is enable the email logs in WP Mail SMTP, and the plugin will take care of the rest.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Turn on email logs" class="wp-image-309818 perfmatters-lazy" data-sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" data-src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wpmailsmtp-email-log.png" data-srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wpmailsmtp-email-log.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wpmailsmtp-email-log-300x183.png 300w" decoding="async" height="335" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='550'%20height='335'%20viewBox='0%200%20550%20335'%3E%3C/svg%3E" title="Turn on email logs" width="550"/><noscript><img alt="Turn on email logs" class="wp-image-309818" decoding="async" height="335" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wpmailsmtp-email-log.png" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wpmailsmtp-email-log.png 550w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wpmailsmtp-email-log-300x183.png 300w" title="Turn on email logs" width="550"/></noscript></figure>
<p>When using this plugin, we have seen how you can easily view your email logs directly inside the WordPress dashboard, which is super convenient.</p>
<p>Here, you can access each email’s delivery status, opens, and clicks, which is great for tracking.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What WooCommerce Metrics and KPIs Should You Be Tracking?</h4>
<p>Keeping tabs on the right WooCommerce metrics is key to making smart, data-backed decisions. Here are the metrics you should keep an eye on: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Conversion rates: </strong>You want to maximize each person that comes to your store. If they leave your site, the chances of them returning are slim to none. Add pop-ups, spin-a-wheel coupons, or even <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-social-proof-wordpress-plugins-easy-to-use/" title="9 Best Social Proof Plugins for WordPress &amp; WooCommerce">social proof</a> on your product pages to help prevent them from bouncing before making a purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Cart abandonment rates: </strong>It can be frustrating to know that your customers leave during checkout. You may want to examine your customer journey. Maybe they checkout due to an unexpected shipping fee. But a simple exit-intent pop-up with a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-offer-a-shipping-discount-in-woocommerce/" title="How to Offer a Shipping Discount in WooCommerce">shipping discount</a> can make a world of difference. </li>
<li><strong>Inventory turnover: </strong>You should know exactly how much you’re selling. That way, you’re never <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-prevent-overselling-out-of-stock-items-in-wordpress/" title="How to Prevent Overselling Out of Stock Items in WordPress">out of stock</a> frantically having to turn down customers in the process. </li>
<li><strong>Bounce rates: </strong>Do your visitors frequently leave your site without fully exploring what you have to offer? In that case, you may want to use heatmap tools to see why visitors are leaving. You could also optimize your page speeds, UI design, or website content. </li>
<li><strong>Net profit: </strong>Making sales is great and all, but you need to keep an eye out for your profits as well. You can increase profits by offering cross-sells and <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-upsell-products-in-woocommerce/" title="How to Upsell Products in WooCommerce (5 Easy Ways)">upsells</a> during checkout or on the thank you page.</li>
<li><strong>Customer retention rates:</strong> Do you often get repeat purchases? Consider offering a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/ultimate-guide-to-creating-a-wordpress-membership-site/" title="Ultimate Guide to Creating a WordPress Membership Site">membership</a> program so customers pay you every month. </li>
