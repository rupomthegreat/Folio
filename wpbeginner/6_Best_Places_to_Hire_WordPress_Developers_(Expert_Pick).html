<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-why-and-when-do-you-need-to-hire-a-wordpress-developer">Why and When Do You Need to Hire a WordPress Developer?</h4>
<p>WordPress is a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-choose-the-best-website-builder/" title="How to Choose the Best Website Builder (Compared)">popular website builder</a> that is quite easy to use, so most people don’t need to hire anyone to create a WordPress website.</p>
<p>However, as your website grows, your costs can increase as well. For more details, you may want to see our beginner’s guide on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-wordpress-website/" title="How Much Does It Really Cost to Build a WordPress Website?">how much it really costs to build a WordPress website</a>.</p>
<p>Many small businesses can run successfully by applying the DIY approach. They can also keep the costs low by using as many free tools and plugins as possible.</p>
<p>But once your website starts making money, you may want to build a custom WordPress theme or plugin for better functionality.</p>
<p>This is where developers come in.</p>
<p>For example, if you have an <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-start-an-online-store/" title="How to Start an Online Store (Step by Step)">online store</a> and want to build a customized eCommerce theme, then you can hire a developer to easily do it for you.</p>
<p>Plus, developers can perform regular maintenance tasks to keep your site updated and improve <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/" title="The Ultimate WordPress Security Guide – Step by Step">WordPress security</a> against hackers and malware.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How We Tested And Reviewed Places to Hire Developers</h4>
<p>Once you decide to hire a developer, you will find thousands of people on the internet offering WordPress development services.</p>
<p>So, how do you find the right platform to hire developers with the technical skill set that you need?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we tested and reviewed different platforms where you can hire developers in real time. When doing that, we paid special attention to the following criteria.</p>
<p><strong>User interface:</strong> We have prioritized platforms with a user-friendly interface and an easy hiring process.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> For each platform, we compared pricing models such as hourly rates, fixed-price projects, and subscription plans.</p>
<p><strong>Client reviews:</strong> We also took a look at reviews from clients who have hired developers through the platform to gain insights into their experiences.</p>
